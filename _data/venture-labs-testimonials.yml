    content: Our team learned a vast amount of problem solving, teamwork, and idea execution tactics from our time with Venture Labs. In our business, from a seasonal standpoint, everyone always has ideas and ‘what ifs’, but they don’t always get planned, executed, or fully thought out strategically. Through Venture Labs, our team gained vast knowledge on how to go about true strategy and execution.

    title: Employee
    content: My experience at Awesome Inc was a timeout from the regular routine of the workday. I appreciated the time to think on what the library does well and how we can enhance our customer's experience. In addition to my own personal reflection, I was able to work in a team with co-workers I don't work with at my library location. I worked with our Multicultural Liaison, HR coordinator, fellow children's librarian, and adult services librarian. This collaboration would not have been possible in the routine of a regular work week. This allowed us all to think outside of our normal boxes and work on a project where we all contributed and presented as a team.
