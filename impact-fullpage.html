      <h1>Awesome Inc U</h1>
      <p>Since we launched Awesome Inc U in 2013, we have learned a lot about software development, but we have learned more about people. We have seen people start new careers in tech, including single mothers, people who were "too old", and people whose prior experience in blue collar or service work seemed like barriers. Our students continue to surprise their naysayers, and even surprise themselves.<br>Our youth students continue to excel, too. We have enjoyed growing partnerships with local schools, which helps us make coding classes accessible to more students. Coding is an exercise in literacy for a generation that has grown up with apps all around them. If software is eating the world, shouldn't people all over the world be equipped to create it? If our youth students are any indication, Kentucky code is as good as any you will find in top tech hubs.<br>We're really excited for a future filled with better technology, built locally, by people who took the time to learn and better themselves.</p>
