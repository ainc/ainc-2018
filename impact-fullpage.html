        We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue their definition of Awesome. This is the reason that we started Awesome Inc in 2009.  We want people to discover their passion, enhance their strengths, and be comfortable owning their uniqueness while in pursuit of their dreams. We believe that creating a bustling startup community in Central Kentucky will allow more people to be able to pursue their dreams right here in Kentucky. We want to send a huge thank you to those who inspire us to keep pursuing OUR passions - startups, mentors, team alpha, community partners, sponsors, supporters, and friends - thank YOU!

        You are making KY a better place to work and live!

        - Brian Raney, Awesome Inc Cofounder

        <h4>The World’s First Real-Time Substance Use Treatment Locator Site</h4>
          <h4>The Project</h4>
          Find Help Now (findhelpnow.org) is creating a faster and more personalized way for people to access treatment for substance use disorders (SUD). After an exhaustive search for the right partner, the Find Help Now team chose APAX Software to design and develop a new responsive website that modernizes and expedites the search for substance use treatment and recovery options. APAX partnered with the Kentucky Injury Prevention and Research Center (KIPRC) to build a highly responsive, mobile-friendly, easy-to-use, section 508 compliant website to facilitate access to SUD treatment centers. Near real-time availability of SUD treatment openings drastically reduces the time spent by health care professionals, families, and individuals seeking treatment programs. Users can filter facilities based on location, facility type, gender identity, the type of treatment needed, and more.
          
          <h4>The Outcome</h4>
          Within one year, the Find Help Now site reduced the time to find treatment and recovery options from 72 hours to 6 minutes and had 253,803 visitors from all 50 states. In addition, the Find Help Now model is now being implemented by 14 other states across the US.

        <p>Since we launched Awesome Inc U in 2013, we have learned a lot about software development, but we have learned more about people. We have seen people start new careers in tech, including single mothers, people who were "too old", and people whose prior experience in blue collar or service work seemed like barriers. Our students continue to surprise their naysayers, and even surprise themselves.<br>Our youth students continue to excel, too. We have enjoyed growing partnerships with local schools, which helps us make coding classes accessible to more students. Coding is an exercise in literacy for a generation that has grown up with apps all around them. If software is eating the world, shouldn't people all over the world be equipped to create it? If our youth students are any indication, Kentucky code is as good as any you will find in top tech hubs.<br>We're really excited for a future filled with better technology, built locally, by people who took the time to learn and better themselves.</p>

        <p>A mentor-driven program designed to accelerate Kentucky's high tech startups. The program is tailored to each startup's needs and runs on a flexible timeline supporting the startup for up to one year. 

        2019 has been a significant year for the growth and mission of our Fellowship. What we continue to find is that Kentucky startups appreciate the accountability, technical resources and partnerships provided by the program. Our favorite startups to work with are led by dedicated founders who want to see their mission through and they'll stop at nothing to build their traction. The Fellowship is a great barometer for the pulse of entrepreneurship in Kentucky. 
          
        Led by quality of life and increasingly vibrant ecosystems, watch as more companies start in Kentucky and move to our region. The future is bright!</p>

The Awesome Inc coworking and event space provides a central location for entreprenuers to connect and help each other grow their businesses.  

        2019 has been a year of increased productivity and growth.  Our space has undergone a series of renovations to accommodate more startups and attract new talent in the city of Lexington.  Each person who has stepped in our space has given us an opportunity to meet the needs of each company through workspace and events. This year has proven successful with an increase in members within the space and the addition of private offices to facilitate their team.</p>

        <h1>Omni Life</h1>
        <p>A Fellowship Company, OmniLife, began the program in April of 2019. Since then, the company and its founders have developed a relationship with Awesome Inc employees and members. After Demo Day of our Spring ‘19 Bootcamp, OmniLife hired two of our graduates. The graduates began working as junior developers for the company, while occupying space as Open Desk members at Awesome Inc. One of the perks of being in the Fellowship Program is to receive one year of free coworking for the team. Through the progression of the company, OmniLife raised a large amount of funding which allowed them to rent private office space. When looking for office space, Eric Pahl, co-founder of OmniLife, said that there were other options to rent in Lexington, but nothing could beat the people, community, and support system at Awesome Inc. OmniLife currently occupies a total of 3 offices at Awesome Inc, which allows space for 6 employees. The company consistently makes use of space amenities, including conference rooms, to hold company meetings and employee training. OmniLife has also used the services of our in-house software company, APAX Software.</p>

        <p>After 10 years in the startup space, Awesome Inc made its first major foray into intentional partnerships with corporate companies and organizations. We created a bottom-up innovation-based workshop that drives entrepreneurial thinking in the corporate workspace.
        
        We work with companies who want to encourage employee creativity & passion to grow as a business. We bring our expertise in innovation and cultivating experiences and run the workshop alongside their team.
          
        In the near-term, these efforts associate Awesome Inc with innovative, entrepreneurial thinking, and have begun to tighten the bond between the entrepreneurial and professional communities in the Bluegrass Region. In the long-term, these efforts will plant the seeds of larger partnerships with the corporate community in the region.</p>

        <p>In a huge step of collaboration, the Lexington startup community came together to form Startup Lex - a virtual entrypoint into the tech and startup scene in the Bluegrass. StartupLex serves startup founders in the Bluegrass Region by helping them grow their business and nurturing the startup ecosystem. It is non-profit lead and exists to help anyone immerse themself and their business into the Central Kentucky community. 

        In order to make jumping into Lexington's scene as easy as possible, we launched a website, a Slack channel, and a Guidebook to give anyone all the information they need to know about the Startup Lex - the people, companies, investors, and groups to know about! Together with the Startup Lex Board, we're excited to support the community and spread the word about Lexington's tech and startup momentum!</p>

It's high-energy, intense, and one of our favorite community-building events. Often during Startup Weekend, teams create surveys to get feedback on their ideas. This year, the Startup Lex Slack channel became an easy and effective way not only to get feedback, but also to begin conversations between strangers and facilitate long-term partnerships working together toward the same goal - innovation and creativity in the Bluegrass!</p>

This year during Global Entrepreneurship Week, three women in the startup community identified a gap in the ecosystem that they decided to fill: a consistent place for women to connect in the Lexington startup community. So during GEW, they hosted the first meetup downtown, attracting over 30 women. This initiative exemplifies the goal of Startup Lex: to create an accessible community, facilitate connections among community members, and share the information so that groups like this can continue to organically form and grow to serve founders.</p>
