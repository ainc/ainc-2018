        We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue their definition of Awesome. This is the reason that we started Awesome Inc in 2009.  We want people to discover their passion, enhance their strengths, and be comfortable owning their uniqueness while in pursuit of their dreams. We believe that creating a bustling startup community in Central Kentucky will allow more people to be able to pursue their dreams right here in Kentucky. We want to send a huge thank you to those who inspire us to keep pursuing OUR passions - startups, mentors, team alpha, community partners, sponsors, supporters, and friends - thank YOU!

        You are making KY a better place to work and live!

        - Brian Raney, Awesome Inc Cofounder

        The World’s First Real-Time Substance Use Treatment Locator Site
          
          The Project
          Find Help Now (findhelpnow.org) is creating a faster and more personalized way for people to access treatment for substance use disorders (SUD). 
          
          After an exhaustive search for the right partner, the Find Help Now team chose APAX Software to design and develop a new responsive website that modernizes and expedites the search for substance use treatment and recovery options. 
          
          APAX partnered with the Kentucky Injury Prevention and Research Center (KIPRC) to build a highly responsive, mobile-friendly, easy-to-use, section 508 compliant website to facilitate access to SUD treatment centers. 
          
          Near real-time availability of SUD treatment openings drastically reduces the time spent by health care professionals, families, and individuals seeking treatment programs. Users can filter facilities based on location, facility type, gender identity, the type of treatment needed, and more.
          
          The Outcome
          Within one year, the Find Help Now site reduced the time to find treatment and recovery options from 72 hours to 6 minutes and had 253,803 visitors from all 50 states. In addition, the Find Help Now model is now being implemented by 14 other states across the US.

        <p>Since we launched Awesome Inc U in 2013, we have learned a lot about software development, but we have learned more about people. We have seen people start new careers in tech, including single mothers, people who were "too old", and people whose prior experience in blue collar or service work seemed like barriers. Our students continue to surprise their naysayers, and even surprise themselves.<br>Our youth students continue to excel, too. We have enjoyed growing partnerships with local schools, which helps us make coding classes accessible to more students. Coding is an exercise in literacy for a generation that has grown up with apps all around them. If software is eating the world, shouldn't people all over the world be equipped to create it? If our youth students are any indication, Kentucky code is as good as any you will find in top tech hubs.<br>We're really excited for a future filled with better technology, built locally, by people who took the time to learn and better themselves.</p>
