The Web Developer Bootcamp at Awesome Inc has helped more than 50 people make a career switch and land new jobs in tech. This is possible not only through our continuously-refined technical curriculum and experienced instructors, but also through great employer connections and plenty of employability prep for our alumni. This is where our Career Coach comes in. A great career coach leads with empathy, understanding the unique backgrounds of each of our students, as well as the unique needs and team cultures of area employers. The coach makes and maintains connections within the tech community, and works 1-on-1 with our Bootcamp students to accompany them through job applications, interviews, and offer negotiations.
