Coding Coaches are the foundation of our instructional team for our youth programs like the Academy, Coding Club, Coding League, and Week of Code summer camp. An ideal candidate for the Coding Coach, Youth courses role would be an experienced software developer who finds joy in sharing their knowledge with others. With a breadth of new languages, frameworks, and platforms arriving on the scene each year, we're less concerned with the code you've already written than your ability to learn whatever our students need you to learn (and help them learn) next.
