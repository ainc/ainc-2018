  Creating nice looking materials to help market your company can be difficult
  to achieve on your own. If you’re in a role where you are always needing a new
  graphic or marketing material created but don’t have access to a designer,
  join us in the Intro to Design course made for marketers.  This part-time,
  evening course, is developed to introduce you to design principles and tools
  that empower you to create well-designed materials for your company.  This
  course occurs two nights per week (Tuesdays and Thursdays), 6:30pm to 8:00pm,
  for 8 weeks. No prior design knowledge or experience is required, but basic
  computer skills (typing, using a web browser, etc.) are suggested. The Intro
  to Design course is created to focus on helping professionals in the marketing
  and events workplace. In addition to in-class hours, our instructor is
  available for Q&A throughout the week via Slack.
