### Do you have students at your school who enjoy spending time on the computer, could play Minecraft for hours, or have done the Hour of Code?

The Coding Club is the place to take that interest in technology, and turn it into a productive skill. Designed for boys and girls in elementary and middle school who want to try out programming, the Coding Club is a fun way to learn to code in a social, after-school setting. Students explore coding using the popular Scratch programming language from MIT. We make a series of video game and animation projects, which help students learn the core concepts of coding and computer science.

The Coding Club meets one afternoon a week for up to 90 minutes, with up to 12 weeks of classes in the Spring and Fall. Sign up with friends, or meet new people with similar interests. No prior programming experience is required, but students should be comfortable using a mouse, keyboard, and web browser.

## Coding Club Outcomes:

- Learn to apply computational thinking to solve problems
- Create your own programs and video games using MIT Scratch
- Meet other students learning to code
