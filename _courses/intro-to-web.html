                <p>The best learning doesn’t just happen when you’re taught information. It comes when you connect with others who are learning alongside you. Intro to Web is designed to both teach you the skills, and foster connections. Intro also offers more flexibility as a part-time, evening course; It covers most of the introductory topics used in our more intensive Bootcamp program, but at a more manageable pace. It'll help you build a solid foundation in web development using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And if you don’t even know what those are... it’s ok! </p>
                <br>
