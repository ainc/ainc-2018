<p>The Web Developer Bootcamp is a 16-week, intensive training program for aspiring software developers. We’ve worked with companies throughout the region to design a curriculum to prepare you to dive into a career in software development. This rigorous learning experience is designed to quickly take you from the basics of programming to a professional level of competency in building modern web applications. With over 500 hours of hands-on training, you’ll gain experience while building 10+ projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web frameworks, GitHub, Agile, and more.</p>

<p>Students begin with a part-time Prework phase, with 4 weeks of remote lessons covering the basics of web development. After that, we kick it into high gear for 12 weeks of full-time, in-person training. We’ve designed Bootcamp to feel less like school, and more like your first 3 months on the job. By the conclusion of the combined 16-week program, our alumni are ready to interview with regional and national employers for the opportunity to earn a full-time position at a competitive junior developer’s salary.</p>

    <p>"Over the last two weeks I have used every little bit of experience from Bootcamp, in some way. And I was able to go from a paragraph description from a client to a deployment-ready web application involving teams, team captains, payment gateway APIs, logging and tracking admin, image uploads, signup invites, social media event link invites and shares - all in a new language and framework. All this practically all on my own.</p>
    <p>There's no way I would have been able to figure any of it out or do so well, without Bootcamp."</p>

<p>There is a four-step, competitive <a href="/applications/bootcamp">application process</a> for the Bootcamp program:</p>

<p><img src="/images/aincu/bootcamp-application-process.png" alt="Bootcamp Application Process" class="img-responsive" /></p>

<p>This process helps us to find top-quality applicants for the Bootcamp. We continue to be surprised and inspired by the variety of different educational and professional backgrounds from which our students come to Bootcamp. Contrary to stereotypes about software developers, there’s not just one archetype that’s a good fit for this career. Our goal throughout the application process is to find people who, in their own unique way, are ready to dive into a software development career through the accelerated learning environment we provide.

            <p>Employers around the country are experiencing a shortage of well-qualified software developers, and Kentucky is no different. While there are several possible responses to this need, many regions have benefited from intensive training programs called Developer Bootcamps. The general model is a 3-month program, in batches of 10-20 students, with a curriculum for full-stack web development jobs. Bootcamps are taught by experienced software developers (10+ years industry experience), with a focus on quickly moving from basic skills to project experience. High job placement rates (&gt;80% within 180 days of graduation) are the target for these programs. Successful programs are highly selective of their applicants, typically targeting college graduates and experienced professionals in their 20s, 30s, and 40s looking to make a career change.</p>

            <p>Our ideal applicants are professional men and women who are looking to transition into a career in software development. This program is not for everyone. Like all Awesome Inc initiatives, we've built this program on the foundation of our <a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org/about/#core-values">Core Values</a>. CV #2 (Be Excellent) is a big part of this program. We expect that many of our candidates will have deep experience in a related field, such as graphic design, math/finance, or project management. Some applicants will have prior programming experience, maybe a class back in high school or college, but many will not.<br /><br />Most of our applicants reside in Kentucky, and desire to live and work in the region after Bootcamp. Since the 12-week in-person phase of our program is full-time (8am - 5pm, five days per week), our candidates must be willing to sacrifice other commitments (such as outside employment) to focus on learning for that duration.</p>

            <p>Our curriculum provides what we and our employer partners see as necessary skills for a junior-level software developer. First, we'll help you learn how to learn (seriously, there are some lifehacks you'll wish you had during college chemistry class). Then we will start with programming and computer science basics, dive into the building blocks of web pages (HTML, CSS, JS), then get into the server side of web applications (databases, SQL, Python/Node.js/Ruby/PHP, web frameworks, AWS), all with plenty of exposure to modern development systems and tools (Git, GitHub, Agile, TDD, UI/UX design). Through all of this, our focus is on making real, working software projects. We can print off a certificate for you at the end if you're the sentimental type, but this experience is really about making things, working with a team, building your project portfolio, and networking with the local developers and companies who we hope will be your future co-workers and employers.<br /><br />As software development is a rapidly-changing field, we update some our specific technology offerings for each cohort. A few past offerings:<br /><br />
            Spring 2019: JavaScript, PHP, VueJS, MySQL, Laravel, Heroku<br />
            Fall 2018: JavaScript, PHP, VueJS, PostgreSQL, Laravel, Heroku<br />
            Summer 2018: JavaScript, PHP, VueJS, PostgreSQL, Laravel, Heroku<br />

            <p>The first four weeks of Bootcamp lessons are delivered remotely. We do this for a few reasons. First, we want to hit the ground running on week one of the in-person phase, while minimizing the time our students spend out of full-time work. Our students start with different prior experiences, so we want to make sure everyone is starting at (nearly) the same spot. And we want that spot to be somewhere beyond absolute zero. Our program is an intense 16 weeks, but without the prework, we couldn't fit in all that you'll need.<br /><br />
            The <a href="/intro-to-web-development/">Intro to Web Development</a> is a part-time, evening course intended to cover most of the Prework content, with the added benefits of an in-person instructor and a slower pace (nine weeks instead of four). For someone who wants to explore coding before committing to Bootcamp, or who wants to get a head start on Bootcamp content, the Intro to Web Development is a great opportunity.</p>
