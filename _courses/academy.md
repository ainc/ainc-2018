So, you’ve got the basics down. You’ve taken a class or two, followed some tutorials, built a few “Hello, world” programs. How do you go beyond learning-to-code and take your software development skills to the next level? The Awesome Inc Academy is our answer.

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kSqzDzU-Bxo"></iframe></div>

The Academy is our premier training program for high school students who aspire to be software developers. This program runs for 14 weeks each Spring and Fall semester, and meets twice a week, two hours per night. During program sessions, our team of coding coaches work with each student to select a challenging final project, assess his or her current skill level, then design a curriculum to help them achieve their goals. Students work alongside other highly-talented peers to gain exposure to a breadth of topics, not just their own focus area. In addition to 56 in-class hours, our coaches are available throughout the semester via Slack online chat.

Academy Outcomes:

*   Make your own Apps, Games, and Websites
*   Learn Software Development methodology, communication skills, and teamwork
*   Meet professional programmers from local tech companies

            <p>Yes. Each student will need to provide his/her own laptop for the course. Microsoft Windows-based PC's, Apple macOS computers, and Linux machines should all work fine. However, Chromebooks and iPads will not work for this course. We recommend a laptop made within the past 3-4 years. Computers should be free from viruses/malware. We have a very limited number of rental laptops available for $25/day, which can be <a href="https://squareup.com/market/awesome-inc/laptop-rental/">reserved online</a>.</p>
