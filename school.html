          <h5 class="heading-subtitle">COVID Safety Guidelines</h5>
          <p>Our space is set up well to allow us to follow these health safety measures:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Classes will be capped at 10 students to ensure we can distance the students around the room</li>
            <li>Our team will be conducting cleanings before and after the students arrive for the camp each day.</li>
            <li>Temperature checks will be conducted at our discretion. Students with temperatures greater than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit will not be permitted to join us that day, and individuals must be fever-free without using medicine to reduce the fever for at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li>We will require masks to be worn except for when students are at their own desk without an instructor within 6 feet of them.</li>
