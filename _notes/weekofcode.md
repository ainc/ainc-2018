## Overview

What if you spent your summer learning to make your own apps instead of just playing them? This camp introduces the fundamentals of coding. Students will create websites, mobile apps, and video games all while having fun with our energetic team.

### What you will do this week

* Learn basic Computer Science concepts
* Write code in C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Build iOS and Android mobile apps with Thunkable
* Design and Publish your own Website
* Create your own Video Game with Unity 3D
* Receive 1-on-1 support from our instructional team
* Share a project presentation with peers and parents

### Prerequisites

* The ability to type text on a computer (e.g. write an email, edit a Word document). We recommend [20 WPM](https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english) or faster.
* Experience using a variety of websites, games, and apps

### Equipment and Account setup

* Students each need to bring a computer with macOS/Windows (must have permission to install programs, including necessary passwords)
* Software: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Unity - personal edition](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal)
* Accounts: [Google account](https://accounts.google.com) (Gmail, Google Drive, etc), [Unity account](https://id.unity.com/), [Mozilla Webmaker account](https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US), [CodeCombat account](https://codecombat.com/) (get special class code from instructors)

## Schedule Summary

[Pre-work](#prework-day) - Intro to programming concepts with Angry Birds, Codecademy, Scratch, JavaScript

## Detailed Schedule

<h3 id="prework-day">Pre-work (self-guided prep session)</h3>

#### Computer Setup

Each student will need to provide his/her own laptop for the course. Either Microsoft Windows-based PC's, or Apple macOS computers will work, but iPads and Chromebooks will **not** work for this course. We recommend a laptop made within the past 3-4 years. Computers should be free from viruses/malware. We have a limited number of [rental laptops available for $25/day](https://squareup.com/market/awesome-inc/laptop-rental).

To be ready for Day 1 of camp, students should complete the following laptop setup steps:

1. Install any available operating system updates for your computer (see [Windows Update](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10) or [macOS software update](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541))
2. Install the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) web browser
3. Use your [Google account](https://accounts.google.com) (Gmail, Google Drive, etc) to sign into [Thunkable](https://thunkable.com/#/)

There are other setup steps (eg installing Unity 3D) that can be completed after Day 1 of camp.

#### Coding Basics

Prior to the Week of Code summer camp, it's a good idea to try some basic coding exercises on your own. If you have not yet done an Hour of Code session on your own or in school, we recommend starting there:

* Watch [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw)
* Do the [Angry Birds and Plants vs Zombies](https://learn.code.org/hoc/1) challenge
* [Make your own Flappy Bird game](https://learn.code.org/flappy/1)
* [Light Bot](https://lightbot.com/hocflash.html)
* [MIT Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)

* * *
