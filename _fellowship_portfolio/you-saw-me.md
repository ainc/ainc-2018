You Saw Me invented the Verve, a patented machine-washable retroreï¬‚ective vest embedded with custom-color LEDs for runners, bicyclists, and ANYONE wanting to be noticed. We've created a fun, functional way to save the lives of pedestrians on the road. Visibility safety meets cool; customizability meets versatility; brighter is better; you saw me.
