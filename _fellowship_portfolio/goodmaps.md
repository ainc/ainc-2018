GoodMaps indoor mapping and positioning technology comes within a few feet, while other companies' accuracy varies between a dozen and 30+ feet. For people who are blind or a first responder, this improvement in accuracy makes digital maps actually usable and more simple. GoodMaps requires no infrastructure or beacons in a building.
