DonorCentric is building a modern communications and data platform for nonprofits to replace current Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) systems. This platform helps nonprofits retain existing and engage new donors. DonorCentric's first offering is a donation service that allows nonprofits to quickly start accepting donations online. The service includes automatic receipting and gift entry which reduces errors and saves time for nonprofits.
