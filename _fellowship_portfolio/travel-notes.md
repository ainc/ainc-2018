Travel Notes automatically notifies financial institutions of their cardholders' travel plans when they purchase airline tickets, so their card is not declined when traveling outside of their normal geographic area. While doing this, Travel Notes automatically helps cardholders secure compensation ($450+) from airlines that travelers are entitled to when their flight is delayed, canceled, or overbooked.
