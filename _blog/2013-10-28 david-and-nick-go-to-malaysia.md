<p>Early in October, Nick Such and David Booth of Awesome Inc, participated in <a href="http://www.globalstartupyouth.org" target="_blank">Global Startup Youth</a> at the fourth <a href="http://www.geskualalumpur2013.org" target="_blank">Global Entrepreneur Summit</a> in Malaysia. Global Startup Youth brings together over 500 young men and women from over 100 countries (250 from Malaysia) for an ideas accelerator to turn ideas into business ventures to solve real world health, environment, education, and women&rsquo;s empowerment issues. The Malaysian Ministry of Finance, the US Department of State, Up Global, and several other sponsors made it possible for these youth to go on this all-expense paid trip. This event is very similar to Startup Weekend, but on a much larger scale. At the end of the event is the Global Entrepreneur Summit itself, which is a gathering of over 18,000 participants in a collaborative environment, with guest speakers from around the world. </p>

<p>Global Startup Youth brings in over 100 mentors from around the world to assist the participants in developing their products. Nick Such was invited to attend the event as one of the mentors. The team he mentored went on to win the event with an application called Milestone. Milestone is designed to compare a users’ career plan with the path that their selected role models took on their own personal paths to success, offering recommendations for improving the user’s future outlook.</p>

<p>David attended as a youth participant and was on the STFree team. Their application is a mobile app that helps to stop the spread of STD’s, mainly in developing countries. It allows people to anonymously notify past sexual partners (and their partners) that they are all at risk for an STD, and sends educational materials to those who also test positive. I had the chance to speak to David after returning. He said it was one of the most amazing experiences of his life. “Getting to work with people from over 100 different countries was incredible. My team itself was made up of ten people from nine different countries.”</p>
