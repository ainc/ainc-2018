<p>If you’re like me, you thrive on productivity.  There is nothing I enjoy more than knocking out todo lists or accomplishing goals.  And I experience that feeling at it’s max when I get into the zone and optimize my productivity.</p>
<p>Here are four tips for helping you get into the zone regularly.</p>
<ol><li>Find your optimal flow time - For me this is midnight to 3 am.  It’s when I can crank, uninterrupted, and get tons of stuff done.  Some people work best in the mornings.  Figure out your optimal time and try to stick to it for an extended period of time (months at a time).  My biggest suggestion is that you have to avoid distractions - so if you find that your optimal flow time is, say the afternoons, then lock yourself in a closet and don’t let anyone interrupt (not always ideal for people with jobs that require meetings with other normal people on a regular basis).</li>
<li>Determine your optimal flow environment - Maybe you’re more productive listening to music, maybe you’re more efficient with multiple displays, perhaps you need a coffee within arms reach, or maybe you work better in your boxers.  For me, it’s at my kitchen table, external mouse is mandatory, listening to music, drinking a Mt. Dew.</li>
<li>Create a todo list - Create and reread your entire todo list before you start.  Check things off as you go.  It feels good.  If it’s not on your todo list, DON’T DO IT&hellip;unless it’s super urgent (but it rarely is).  I also recommend starting with the hardest things on your todo list.</li>
<li>Reward yourself after the being in the zone - I go watch a tv show or a movie after successfully being in the zone for a few hours.  Either that, or I read blog posts by startup experts like <a href="http://okdork.com/" target="_blank">Noah Kagan</a> or <a href="http://feld.com/" target="_blank">Brad Feld</a>.  Let yourself do something fun after being ultra productive.  Play a video game, hang out with friends, eat some double stuff oreos.<br/><br/></li>
