description: Your awareness contributes to the greater good of the team.

Each person plays a significant role (yes, even if your title isn’t a three-letter acronym) in every organization. People often lack the awareness to see their value because they haven’t met a specific benchmark or milestone. It’s time to change that! 

**Your awareness contributes to the greater good of the team.** 

Awareness is the knowledge or perception of a situation or fact(1), or how you are perceived by other people(2). This is something I’ve learned from performance  meetings and mentors in my life. 

Awareness is necessary in three areas: 

1. Attraction
2. Gratitude
3. Consistency

**Attraction**

* You draw to you what you are.

  * Average, Mediocre, or maybe worse...
* What you consume will ultimately consume you.

  * How you spend your time is how you spend your life. 
* Sincerity and warmth make people feel appreciated.

  * Do you repel or welcome people? Relationships require more effort than saying “Hi” or “I’m good.”

**Gratitude**

This is your readiness to show appreciation for something and to return kindness. In the workplace (and at home), ask yourself if you’re adding to or taking from your environment. When both attraction and gratitude are in play, they complement each other well.

**Consistency**

Predictability and reliability are the building blocks of trust. A few ways to become more predictable and reliable for others are to develop your self-control, self-validation, and listening abilities. 

1. Do you understand your limits and/or boundaries? This can be in any area of life.
2. Do you often find your worth because of something someone said?
3. In a conversation, do you respond immediately after  someone finishes talking? Be intentional and actually hear what someone is saying. We were given two ears and one mouth for a reason… try to listen twice as much as you speak!

To wrap things up, don’t forget…
