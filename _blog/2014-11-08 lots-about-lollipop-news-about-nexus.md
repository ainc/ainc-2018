<p><span>           </span>Recently, Google announced the official release for the next version of their popular mobile operating system, Android 5.0 “Lollipop.” The update will be available for users in the coming weeks and launch on Google’s new flagship phone, the Nexus 6. The biggest news for developers is that the Software Development Kit (SDK) was released on October 17, and this allows app creators to implement some of the exciting new capabilities that come with the update. Now developers have a chance to show off implementations of what they were shown when the Android L preview was unveiled at Google I/O in June. Here’s a rundown of what’s new and relevant to developers, sourced from the <a href="http://developer.android.com/" target="_blank">Android Developer</a> site. </p>
<h3>New UI Guidelines</h3>
<p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="600" data-orig-width="800" data-orig-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5tMjq3izQ9UzYpaN1V1LMtbiRL3_LsbGerjO8whi3tG3RXf0YCwt1Spa96BcNZm4wLbW-RMA4dWS9nGeKyDsuy1gmB3rjDt4Txst8Iy7lnTpAoeHgk-8TH92tqNHsbqj3w"><img alt="image" height="299px;" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/2db98934924a45a335ffd33bc40fe066/tumblr_inline_pk18s7h6IT1spm8pc_540.gif" width="401px;" data-orig-height="600" data-orig-width="800" data-orig-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5tMjq3izQ9UzYpaN1V1LMtbiRL3_LsbGerjO8whi3tG3RXf0YCwt1Spa96BcNZm4wLbW-RMA4dWS9nGeKyDsuy1gmB3rjDt4Txst8Iy7lnTpAoeHgk-8TH92tqNHsbqj3w"/></figure></p>
<p>What: Google Material Design - “A design metaphor inspired by paper and ink that provides a reassuring sense of tactility.”</p>
<p>Who it affects: Anyone who wants their Android app to look really cool.</p>
<p>Back at <a href="https://www.google.com/events/io" target="_blank">Google I/O</a> this summer, a new set of design guidelines, dubbed <a href="http://www.google.com/design/" target="_blank">Material Design</a>, was introduced. These standards will dictate the look and feel of Android and Google-produced applications, and Android 5.0 introduces some new elements to encourage developers to make their apps consistent with the vision.</p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="476" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ti5-ieeGzbtjtSEUHKXwWR3o_sBsoulf-JFB0wuTaOajaW_TsmMiPGf6_cKyMWnQeeZaqWhbNIgI-66azhl8oLxh2K5yIW_FEIhJFk-dDCz-_eqvX6imu1nqvRER7U65Ww"><img alt="image" height="297px;" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/280688f16197580a1f34f46fabee520c/tumblr_inline_pk18s8nDw51spm8pc_540.png" width="308px;" data-orig-height="476" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ti5-ieeGzbtjtSEUHKXwWR3o_sBsoulf-JFB0wuTaOajaW_TsmMiPGf6_cKyMWnQeeZaqWhbNIgI-66azhl8oLxh2K5yIW_FEIhJFk-dDCz-_eqvX6imu1nqvRER7U65Ww"/></figure></p>
<p>The main elements for material design-consistent apps that are new include <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/material/theme.html" target="_blank">a new app theme</a>, new widget implementations, and new APIs for animations throughout the app.</p>
<h3>New Runtime Environment</h3>
<p>What: Android Runtime (ART)</p>
<p>Who it affects: Developers who care about what goes on behind-the-scenes</p>
<p>On the backend of things, Lollipop has introduced a new runtime environment called ART. Originally an experiment on the previous release, KitKat, ART doesn’t need existing apps to change to experience the benefits. ART provides what is called  “ahead-of-time” compilation, which allows apps to run faster and more efficiently. This mean an app is compiled all at once at the start instead of on-the-fly as in the <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik/" target="_blank">current Dalvik model,</a> which should cause considerable speed increase. Some other benefits are more debugging tools and better crash reports for developers.</p>
<h3>New Notifications</h3>
<p>What: Lock screen visibility for notifications</p>
<p>Who it affects: Developers of apps with notifications</p>
<p><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>In addition to inheriting the smooth Material Design animations, notifications are getting some special upgrades in Android Lollipop. Notifications are now visible front and center on the lock screen rather than just in the notification pane. Because of this, apps now have the option to create visibility options for their notifications. Instead than the default notification, apps can choose to show a message on the notification rather than its content when the phone is locked, or keep their notifications from appearing on the lockscreen at all.</p>
<h3>New resource manager</h3>
<p>What: New ways for apps to save battery</p>
<p>Who it affects: Developers who care about conserving resources (hopefully everyone)</p>
<p>One of the biggest things in Android 5.0 is a push for improving battery life, and this includes providing tools for helping apps use less battery. Codenamed <a href="https://www.google.com/events/io/io14videos/64bf2234-4bcb-e311-b297-00155d5066d7" target="_blank">Project Volta</a>, the initiative adds new APIs that allow apps to do cool things like schedule processes to run at time when the phone is plugged in, or on Wi-Fi instead of cellular. These tools work too; <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/07/examining-project-volta-we-put-android-l-through-our-battery-test/" target="_blank">Ars Technica reports</a> that these tactics can cause a 36% increase in battery life on a Nexus 5.</p>
<h1>The new Nexus lineup</h1>
<p>           To show off what this new software can do, Google has updated its first-party phone line, Nexus. The Nexus line is mainly a reference device with tight integration and optimization of the new software, usually sold through Google, but now available through major cell carriers. The first new device announced was the Nexus 6, a massive phone with a 5.96 inch 1440p display. It boasts a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 805, Adreno 420 graphics, and 3 GB RAM. Mostly a souped up 2nd gen Moto X, it also has a 13 MP rear camera with optical image stabilization, 4K video, and dual-front facing speakers. If there’s any device that makes Lollipop look like a champ, this is it. </p>

<p>            For the tablet side of things, the Nexus 9 was introduced, with a 8.9 inch IPS LCD display, an Nvidia Tegra K1 processor and Kepler GPU. It too will have dual front-facing speakers, and will be a prime showcase for Android Lollipop.  </p>
<p>            The most intriguing new addition is the Nexus Player, a media streaming box like Android TV. It features a voice activated remote, an optional game controller and Google Play centric-home screen. It features Chromecast capability and can mirror select iOS devices, Android devices, pages in Chrome on any computer,  and Chromebooks. The player looks to replace the game console, with free online multiplayer in Google Play, and synchronization with the companion phone app. </p>

<p>           Google is really stepping up its game this time around, with important updates for developers and users alike. Material design gives Android the visual update it needs, and ART gives it the performance it needs to stay relevant in today’s discerning market. The new Nexus line will really be able to show off what the new Android can do. For more about the new update, see <a href="https://android.com" target="_blank">https://android.com</a>.</p>
