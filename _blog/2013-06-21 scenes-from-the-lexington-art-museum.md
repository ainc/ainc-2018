<p>Scenes from The Lexington Art Museum is an exhibition of work by three local artists, Megan Sauter, Laura Sebastian, and Anthony Woodruff. These three artists recently co-authored a book, “The Lexington Art Museum” and this exhibition is inspired by the artist’s individual contributions to the text. </p>

<p>The idea that Lexington should be seen as an art museum full of unique works of art is the concept for the book and the exhibition. Every day we walk beside, over, and under art that goes unnoticed and unappreciated. This exhibition encourages the viewer to become more aware of what “The Lexington Art Museum” has to offer!</p>
