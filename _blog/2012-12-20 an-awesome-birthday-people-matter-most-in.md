<p>Last week I turned 31 and had an awesome Birthday party.  Yes, that is it above.  A bunch of my friends sitting around working&hellip;working on the project that has been my passion for the last four years.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a huge believer in doing life with your business partners and co workers. I give talks to student entrepreneurs all the time about the importance of having a great team. I believe that most of the success and all of the happiness you&rsquo;ll experience in your business venture will be influenced by the people around you. This is the case for entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs alike, but entrepreneurs have an advantage because we get to pick our teammates.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very fortunate that my friends and the people I work with have a lot of overlap. My birthday party last week was a perfect example of this. This was not a typical birthday party, but it was the most appropriate gift my friends could give. We didn&rsquo;t go see a movie, go out to dinner, or hit up the clubs. Instead, we met at the offices at Awesome Inc and spent the entire night working on the 2013 version of the Awesome Inc Experience accelerator program. We created marketing materials, launched a website, designed a logo, created promo videos, and planned scheduled outings for the program.</p>
<p>It was a birthday full of awesome&hellip;and full of productivity for my company, Awesome Inc.</p>
<p>I fully recognize that many people will see this as weird or crazy. And that&rsquo;s ok. I never claimed to be normal. One of my friends explained it quite well, &ldquo;This party IS Brian&rsquo;s idea of fun. A lot of people would pick to go to bowling, watch a basketball game, or go to the bar with their friends for their birthday. Brian enjoys his work and would often pick working with his friends over most other options.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t enjoy watching basketball games or doing other more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; fun things with my friends. I actually enjoy those things a lot. I also enjoy being productive and expanding impact. I&rsquo;ve found this to be a common theme among entrepreneurs - they enjoy creation more than consumption.<br/> </p>

<p><em>CV #3: &ldquo;Be a Friend&rdquo; is being painted on the break room wall at Awesome Inc</em></p>
<p>The combination of creation and friendship is core to the culture at Awesome Inc. One of the four core values at Awesome Inc is &ldquo;Be a Friend&rdquo;. The purpose of this core value is to bring the fun to every situation (work related or non-work related) and realize that nothing is more awesome than people. I strongly believe that this is also critical to building a startup community. People are attracted to people that know how to bring the fun and if you&rsquo;re going to build a community you need to know how to attract people.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m extremely lucky to have such talented and fun coworkers and friends. It makes success much more likely and the journey along the way much more enjoyable.</p>
