<p>If you&rsquo;re one of the many who ardently follow apps and recent app news, you are probably familiar with Robert Babcock. Babcock is a co-host of <a href="http://www.the-appcast.com/" target="_blank">Appcast</a>, which is a weekly podcast that updates listeners on new app releases and the current functionality of specific apps.</p>
<p>Along with Kevin Chiou, the duo have created over 100 episodes in their podcasts in Appcast. Each weekly podcast is available for free. The most recent podcast was about alternate web browsers rather than the standard Safari. Babcock will be attending MobileX to discuss the iOS store and its applications.</p>
