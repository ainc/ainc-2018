<p>The Wolfe Law Office is run by attorney Joe Wolfe. Ideally he works with small businesses and entrepreneurs with start ups, but he also does estate planning, divorce, criminal defense, and bankruptcy cases. The Wolfe Law Office strives to provide the highest quality legal services in Kentucky for a reasonable price.</p>
<p>After graduating from the UK College of Law, Wolfe decided to start his own firm in October 2009 instead of joining one that was already established. He had been a member of the Entrepreneurs Club while an undergraduate at UK and wanted the experience of building a company from the ground up.</p>
<p>At first Wolfe faced many challenges starting on his own, such as being his own secretary and working 120 hours a week. However, he now has a law clerk and says that while it&rsquo;s hard work, at least he&rsquo;s working for himself.</p>
