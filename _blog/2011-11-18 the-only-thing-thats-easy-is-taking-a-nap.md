<p>I have never met anyone that&rsquo;s ever done something of significance and when it was over say &lsquo;you know, it ended up taking way less time that we thought it would and it was sooo much easier than we expected&rsquo;. It just doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p>NOTHING is going to be as easy as you think. This is really important in a startup because you think about adding a new feature or doing some side project that is tangentially beneficial but not part of your core (your<a href="http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/focus-on-the-hot-dog" target="_blank">hot dog</a>). During your thought process you realize that this isn&rsquo;t the most critical thing in the world to your business (which these are the ONLY types of things you should be spending your time on at this point) but you justify spending the time because 'it&rsquo;s just going to take a couple of hours or an evening&rsquo;. In a word you think it will be 'easy&rsquo;.</p>
<p>You are wrong. Make sure that anything you set out to do you think is important enough to work on even if it becomes difficult&hellip;because it WILL become difficult.</p>
<p>And when you&rsquo;re finished with it – go ahead and do the only thing that actually is easy&hellip;</p>
