<p>Ben Askren inadvertently became an entrepreneur while he was spending time in France a few years ago.</p>
<p>Askren, a University of Kentucky graduate with a degree in mechanical engineering, was traveling around France when he realized that he wanted French casement windows installed in his house after the trip.</p>
<p>After checking out different manufacturers and companies, he decided that it was best to do it himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were going to hire somebody to build the windows for us. We checked out the major manufactures and none of them made the windows except one company, and the company that did made them four inches too wide for the openings that we had and it&rsquo;s a brick house so we couldn&rsquo;t replace those measurements,&rdquo; Askren said. &ldquo;That required us to consult with custom window companies and we found out that they were $5,000 to $11,000 per window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a result of those high costs, Askren put on his carpentry hat and did the project himself. Due to the results of his work he decided that he could be profitable in the construction business. He later quit his job at Lexmark, a job he had held for eighteen and a half years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was the results. The results were outstanding,&rdquo; Askren said of his inspiration to start a business. &ldquo;I was surprised myself about how they turned out and anybody that has been to my house has said that I should go into business making these windows because nobody has seen windows like that here. That&rsquo;s what caused us to ask that question seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After weighing his options he found out that the answer to his question was, temporarily, &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That kind of business was too capital and labor intensive; their pockets weren&rsquo;t deep enough for the equipment and the facilities, as well as the labor, Askren said.</p>
<p>Still itching to start a business, Askren, a husband and father of twins, ultimately decided that his business was going to have to be non-capital intensive and something that he could work on while still having a family life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the entrepreneurial bug. The windows made me appreciate that the types of businesses that I could start were rather limited so I had to really take a lot time and consider what I wanted to get involved with. So we looked at several different options, ultimately settling on the one that we chose because it fit best with the constraints of my family and financial life,&rdquo; Askren said.</p>

<p>The product that Askren created is BuildCalc, a mobile application construction calculator that has the ability to give users layouts for all things construction. Layouts include stairs, arcs and arcs framing, rafters of all types, polygons, and rake walls.</p>
<p>Among other things, it also has functions to make accurate estimates for brick, block, tile, footers, drywall, sheathing, shingles, pickets, post, panels, studs, and more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most advanced construction calculator,&rdquo; Askren said. &ldquo;Specifically what that means is it&rsquo;s a construction calculator to help you with layouts of complicated construction things as well as material estimates. If you want to do stairs, roofs, how much drywall is needed, tile, it can help you with that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a user gets lost and would like to track their previous operations, BuildCalc has the ability to track the last 200 steps made. For on the spot help, BuildCalc can provide assistance for every measurement. If more in-depth help is needed, the application directs users to its website, <a href="http://buildcalc.com/" target="_blank">buildcalc.com</a>. The instruction manual can be found under the &ldquo;<a href="http://buildcalc.com/manual/Manual.pdf" target="_blank">more</a>&rdquo; tab.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s unique in the convenience,&rdquo; Askren said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to find this much power on your cell phone or your tablet, period. If you&rsquo;re on the job site and if you need an answer to a question about how you lay something out or how much material you need, it&rsquo;s the best option by far. Nothing comes close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Askren, competitors&rsquo; limited functions are another reason why BuildCalc is the best construction calculator on the market. His app provides twice as much information as other apps on hip roof layouts and creates multiple drawings of stair layouts. Most importantly, everything can be emailed and printed via air print, unlike other apps which cannot transfer layouts from the phone which they were created on.</p>
<p>BuildCalc is available on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/buildcalc-advanced-construction/id333369423?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D6" target="_blank">iTunes</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buildcalc.buildcalc" target="_blank">Android</a> market for $19.99.</p>
