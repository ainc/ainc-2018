## You're Invited. Yes, You.

This Thursday, May 12, Awesome Inc will be hosting a free [open house event](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/what-is-a-coding-bootcamp-tickets-24488142694) for our upcoming [Web Developer Bootcamp](/applications/bootcamp/). This 12-week program is meant to take you, a user of software, and turn you into a _creator_ of software. The Bootcamp is not meant for geniuses and prodigies. We've made it for ordinary men and women who want to do something extraordinary with their careers. Your most important skills are curiosity and determination, not prior experience with programming. If you're ready to take the leap, we can help you get there.

## The Opportunity

The software development profession has grown leaps and bounds in the past few years, even in not-Silicon-Valley places like Nashville, Columbus, and our own Lexington. A big reason is that software jobs are not only part of the technology industry, but are an increasingly bigger piece of healthcare, banking, even agriculture. You can have an impact on people around the country, working on the software to lead the next U.S. manufacturing revolution (like the team at [MakeTime](https://www.maketime.io/) here in downtown Lex), or you can impact our local community (like the volunteers at [OpenLexington](http://openlexington.org/). Software is all about people.

## The Event

The [Bootcamp Open House](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/what-is-a-coding-bootcamp-tickets-24488142694) on May 12th starts at 6:30pm. We'll have representatives from Awesome Inc U's instructional team, as well as local employers looking to hire aspiring software developers like you. We'll have some drinks and snacks, and answer any questions you have about learning to code, making a career switch, or just about the exciting things happening here in Lexington's technology community.

I can't wait to see you at our [Bootcamp Open House](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/what-is-a-coding-bootcamp-tickets-24488142694) on May 12th.
