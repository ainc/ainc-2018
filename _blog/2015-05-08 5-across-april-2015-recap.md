<p>We’ve just wrapped up another edition of your favorite local pitch competition, <a href="http://www.5across.org/" target="_blank">5 Across</a>. FinanceU took home the giant $500 check and punched a ticket to compete for $5,000 in the 5 Across Finals in December. Although the food arrived late, the crowd didn’t seem to mind. Probably because they were hungry for something else… pitches.<b></b><b><br/></b></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="427" data-orig-width="640"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/6b19210268d73525d2f708e519465900/tumblr_inline_no1eqb3F2d1spm8pc_540.jpg" data-orig-height="427" data-orig-width="640"/></figure><p>For the first course, Cameron Lippert pitched Riot Cosmetics and the “shower in a brush.” The chemically treated brush absorbs oil and grease in hair. </p><p>Next came Heidi Mackenzie with <a href="http://alterurego.co/" target="_blank">Alter-UR-Ego</a>, a fashionable and functional clothing line designed for wheelchair users. Fresh approved. </p><p>OdoRcept, a service that identifies which odor receptors in the nose are activated by a smell was pitched by Tim McClintock. He aims to use OdoRcept as a way for fragrance and flavor companies to perfect their odors.</p><p>Alexander Slabaugh and Ben Patenaude teamed up with their GridU pitch, an app that teaches football players the thinking side of the game. @ALLTheWaffles used GridU’s pitch as the perfect lead in for his <a href="https://twitter.com/ALLTheWaffles/status/593541605291925505" target="_blank">Freshest Tweet</a>, selected by yours truly.</p><p>Last but not least was Michael Lewis and his winning pitch for <a href="http://www.financeu.org/" target="_blank">FinanceU</a>, the second of our “U” suffixed companies. FinanceU uses the wonders of crowdfunding to create custom built scholarships for college students.</p><p>Our five course night of pitches wouldn’t be complete without the green at the end. People eat vegetables for dessert now, right? Riot Cosmetics won the $50 text vote, which amounts to 6.25 Chipotle burritos, in case you were wondering. FinanceU won the night’s $500 prize and a chance to compete for $5,000 in December, that’s a lot burritos folks. </p><p>As always, we look forward to seeing you at the next 5 Across event. The next one will be on May 20 in Ashland. Then after that on June 17 back in Lexington. See you there!</p>
