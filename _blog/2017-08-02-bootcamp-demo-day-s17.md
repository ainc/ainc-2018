In May, a group of aspiring software developers began a 500+ hour journey of intense, hands-on learning in Awesome Inc U's Web Developer Bootcamp. On Thursday, August 10th, this group will be [presenting their final projects](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/awesome-inc-demo-day-web-developer-bootcamp-s17-tickets-36700890351), full-stack web applications, to a group of tech company executives, local software developers, and other members of the Lexington-area technology community.

The first program of its kind in Central Kentucky, the goal of the Web Developer Bootcamp is to help professionals transition into a new career in software development. This in turn helps local companies recruit local tech talent to support their growth, especially as tech moves beyond its own borders and becomes a bigger part of healthcare, manufacturing, finance, and beyond.

The public is invited to join us for the culmination of the Bootcamp program, a Demo Day on Thurs, August 10th from 6-8pm at Awesome Inc. Free registration for the [Bootcamp Demo Day is available on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/awesome-inc-demo-day-web-developer-bootcamp-s17-tickets-36700890351). Each member of the Bootcamp cohort will give a brief presentation of his or her final project, followed by an opportunity to experience each web application hands-on. We'll have light refreshments available throughout the evening. 

PS: Applications are now open for our 2018 cohorts (dates TBA), and can be accessed via the [Bootcamp application page](/applications/bootcamp).
