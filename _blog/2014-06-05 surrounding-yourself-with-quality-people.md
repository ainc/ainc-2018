<p>Have you ever seen crabs kept in a shallow bucket after they have been caught? </p>
<p>Here is a link, just to show you what happens.</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Q4dTF8fRh2A" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>As soon as a crab starts to climb out of the bucket, the other crabs grab the escaping crab and keep him from climbing out. Now, I don&rsquo;t think that crabs have rationalized that they are about to be dinner and they don&rsquo;t want their crab buddy to get out, but it is a good axiom for human behavior. If you have a dream you want to follow or an idea for a business, you should follow that dream. You will likely hear others tell you things like: &ldquo;that will never work&rdquo;, &ldquo;someone would have thought of that by now if it was a good idea&rdquo;, or &ldquo;but what about the security of your current job?&rdquo;.</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc</a> rule #39: “80% of the success and 100% of the Awesomeness you experience in life is determined by those you surround yourself with. SO&hellip;Surround yourself with Awesomeness!” Take a look at your life, write down the five people that you spend most of your time with and signify each with a designated character A, B, C, D, and E. Next to these characters, write down what you think the goals are of these individuals and the level of success or happiness that these people experience. Examine the relationship you have with these people. What are the best qualities of these people? You can always take away something positive from the person and aligning yourself with people who are truly driven to succeed will impact you in a positive way.</p>
<p><span> </span>Being around successful people who have that “spark” is contagious, they seem to emit a positive energy that will rub off on you. They have focused on a goal and are either working towards achieving that goal or have made it and are now reaping the benefits of their labor. Keep these people around you and learn as much as you can from them. The roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote (roughly translated) “It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.” This is one of the reasons that when we find those successful people we strive to do more with our own life.</p>
<p>The people you surround yourself with can help challenge you, which leads to innovation and personal growth. If you find that you are not where you want to be, whether it be career, life, or academics, find a way to create new relationships that will nurture and develop you. There is an old real estate adage, buy the smallest house in a neighborhood, the larger houses surrounding yours will increase your property value. The same concept applies to people, successful people that you keep around you will help to raise you up just by the nature of their company. Once you are there, be the mentor or friend that other people now aspire to be like.</p>
<p><span>So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and get started!</span></p>
