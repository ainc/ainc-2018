<p>A question I have been asked by pretty much everyone I talk with about Ignite (a Cooperative Work Space and Entrepreneurial Center) is “WHY?” Why open this center in Ashland? What is your motivation? My answer has several dimensions: frustration when trying to start my first business because of not having a clear path to get help; the lack of guidance from a mentor when I had tons of questions as a new business owner; being overwhelmed by all the available resources and no direction on which would fit my needs; and the never ending acronyms (SKED, MACED, and SBDC). But mostly my reason comes from the love that I have for my home town and watching friends and young people leave the Ashland area for cities with better opportunities.</p>
<p>‘I can’t wait to get out of this town.’</p>
<p>That’s a phase I hear far too often. And as it turns out, local young adults ARE leaving. I recently listened to a presentation by Ron Crouch, Director of Research and Statistics with Kentucky Career Centers. Part of the presentation discussed population growth from 2000-2010 for each county. Not surprisingly, the counties along all the major interstates show an increase ranging from +3% to +41% (way to go Scott County!). What did surprise me, however, was the one lone county along Kentucky’s interstates showing a decrease – Boyd County – home to Ashland, KY. This statistic infuriates me.</p>
<p>‘What company am I going to work for when I graduate?’</p>
<p>I recently opened the Facebook page for Ignite (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/igniteashland" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/igniteashland</a>), and one of the first comments someone put on the page said, “Small business is all we have here, now that’s not jobs.” Seriously. It’s still there, go look. I was absolutely floored by that comment, but it also convinced me that opening Ignite was the right thing to do and exemplifies one of my primary motivators – that people in and around my hometown think they have no other option for a job but to find employment with a large company. Locals put so much faith and hope in a large company locating to Ashland to bring more jobs instead of recognizing that small business means jobs! According to Forbes, 65% of new jobs created since 1995 have been small business.</p>
<p>What’s the connection between “I can’t wait to get out of this town” and “what company am I going to work for when I graduate?” I think that half of the answer is that the latter causes the former. Graduates, whether high school or college, see no opportunity in Boyd County because most of them do not see doing something on their own or out of the norm as an option. No encouragement for entrepreneurs or startups. No support system in place. No ecosystem for startups.</p>
<p>I recently received an e-mail from someone who read an article about Ignite in a local paper. Nathan Parks said, “I really liked your statement: ‘A problem in this area is young people grow up and ask ‘What big company am I going to go work for?’ I want to break that mold a little bit. I want them to ask, ‘What kind of company or product can I create to create jobs?’”  Nathan started a tech company in Ashland a few years ago and went on to say, “When I started HPCS I started from a similar place. I wanted a technology job but couldn’t find one so I just decided I’d make one. Being able to employ people now that actually appreciate having a tech job is pretty awesome.”</p>
<p>Ignite is about ENCOURAGING those graduates to look at their home town and say, “Ok, I want to work in the field I love, but no one is doing that here. Awesome! Let’s start it.” </p>
