<p><a href="http://modelsensation.com/" target="_blank">ModelSensation</a> is a model photography and promotion company. They help companies advertise products or services, and provide advertising companies with talent for events like commercials or special occasions. ModelSensation hopes to have their brand evolve to licensing contracts to apparel and merchandise and have TV and media products to feature the models.</p>
<p>ModelSensation was founded to provide opportunities for talented people in the Lexington area. ModelSensation&rsquo;s greatest reward has been witnessing models being able to realize their dreams. Acknowledging that people pay attention to beautiful models, ModelSensation wants to direct this attention towards positive messages. ModelSensation is about seeing models as humans and not just a means to sell a product.</p>
<p>For owner Zabu Mutua, photography was just a hobby until he realized that it takes just one person with a dream to become successful. Although ModelSensation has been around for 3 years, they face the challenge that the complexity of even the most modest project requires organization and structure. Image is everything in the modeling world, and ModelSensation strives to always be professional and not miss opportunities due to a lack of foresight.</p>
