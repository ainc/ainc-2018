<p>Webalytics (<a href="http://webalytics.com/" target="_blank">webalytics.com</a>) is a web data management company for website and business owners, stock analysts, and SEO practitioners. They are working on creating a new industry with a new platform for sharing information. Although the finalists haven&rsquo;t been announced yet, Webalytics is looking to beta launch its application at TechCrunch Disrupt this September 27-29.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Disrupt is a startup launch conference that attracts top venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and corporate executives. In Startup Battlefield, twenty five teams are selected from hundreds to demo their products. Each is judged on its product, business model, team, design and usability. The top prize is $50,000 and the media exposure is priceless. Webalytics hopes to be selected to participate in Startup Battlefield because TechCrunch Disrupt is the place to launch a web-based application. Webalytics has created a &ldquo;work of art&rdquo; and wants to unveil it to the largest possible audience.</p>
<p>Webalytics owner Wayne Yeager is no stranger to internet startup companies; Webalytics is his fourth. Others include Sellathon.com, which was acquired by Auctiva in 2006, Trafficology.com and Internet.com, both of which he was editor, and Unclaimed Domains, which was acquired by Jupiter Media in 2000.</p>
<p>As with any of his startups, Yeager&rsquo;s biggest challenge is demonstrating the connection between what Webalytics does and how it makes the customer money. Webalytics will have to make the transition from early adopters to the larger market by being able to show people how the platform provides real, tangible value. However, Webalytics raised a $200,000 angel round earlier this year.</p>
