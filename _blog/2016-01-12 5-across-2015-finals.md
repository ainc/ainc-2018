In a neck to neck competition on the night of December 9th, 5 previous 5 Across competitors came to the stage once again to battle for the $4,000 prize.

</p><p>The competition was fierce.</p><p><a href="http://lexingtonfoodtrucks.com/" target="_blank">Follow That Food Truck!</a> was up first, with their app and website combo that allows Lexington foodies to find their favorite meals on wheels. Their new subscription based model will give food truck companies more ways to connect with their customers, making the experience for everyone who uses their app better. Follow That Food Truck! is passionate about expanding to other markets outside of Lexington, and while they didn’t take home the prize, they left the stage to enthusiastic support. </p><p><a href="http://www.mrendering.com/" target="_blank">mRendering </a>took the stage with their technology that allows companies to distribute important information to their workers, eliminating giant printed manuals. Aleksey Shaporev gave examples of current customers and shared mRendering’s hopes to expand their ability to save lives by providing services to more customers.</p><figure data-orig-width="640" data-orig-height="426" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/7119149d6dfd0ce4b4b3ef32fe34d94d/tumblr_inline_o0uutv9qDw1spm8pc_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="640" data-orig-height="426"/></figure><p>With help from their children, <a href="http://thehillbarrow.com/" target="_blank">Tinker Tech Co</a> pitched their first patented and innovative idea – The Hillbarrow. The Vandelindes outlined their plan to expand The Hillbarrow through working with construction companies and even meeting with Home Depot. They were a crowd favorite and took home the text vote and a crisp $50 bill.</p><p>Michael Lewis with <a href="https://www.financeu.org/" target="_blank">Finance U </a>wowed the crowd with their newly launched website that helps college students pay for college. The Finance U team was passionate, and on true finals fashion, used the entire 5 minutes to pitch their idea. It served them well, as Finance U brought home second place and a giant check for $1,000. The money will go to help college students learn about personal branding and how to fundraise for their future.</p><p><a href="http://www.donorcentric.co/" target="_blank">DonorCentric</a> took the stage with chance to win a 5 Across competition. Charles Buddeke outlined why his company’s technology is the better choice for nonprofits and those looking to donate. While they face competition in the field, they’re working closely with nonprofits, especially those who do not have the advanced tech support. DonorCentric took home the gold, a $4,000 check and their first 5 Across win.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="640" data-orig-height="426" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/ae2a1ae570940233a59b0b041358ad45/tumblr_inline_o0uuj06Okb1spm8pc_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="640" data-orig-height="426"/></figure><p>Congratulations to all our competitors! 5 Across will return in February with brand new teams trying to make their way to finals.
