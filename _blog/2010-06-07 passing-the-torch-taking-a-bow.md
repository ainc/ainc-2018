<p>For those of you that haven&rsquo;t known, I have been behind the scenes at Awesome Inc. running the social media campaign as a volunteer for nearly a year now. I did it in hopes of meeting great people and seeing tech and/or creative communities grow in Lexington. The experience has been wonderful both personally and professionally as I met some great people, some who turned into clients for my <a href="http://amartindesign.com/" target="_blank">graphic design business</a>, and some who turned into valuable colleagues.</p>
<p> During my time at Awesome Inc., we were able to reach some pretty big milestones in the social media space as we achieved over 1,000 <a href="http://www.facebook.com/awesomeincorporated" target="_blank">facebook</a> fans, and 500+ <a href="http://twitter.com/awesome_inc" target="_blank">twitter</a> followers; we also began live streaming events on the social web and responding to viewers in real-time. Something no one was doing at the time in Lexington, KY.</p>
<p>At some of our events, we even experimented with the audience live tweeteing their questions on a screen behind the speakers.</p>
<p>I also introduced the hashtag to Awesome Inc. and perhaps its greatest use was on twitter during the Awesome Inc. Mobile Conference in the summer of 2009. A great community was formed and conference attendees were able to keep up with what others were doing during their time in Lexington, KY. The conference was even later renamed and rebranded based on the hashtag #mobilex for #mobile #lex</p>
<p>My time at Awesome Inc. has indeed been awesome, and it was as a pleasure meeting and interacting with most of you; unfortunately all good things must eventually come to an end.</p>
<p>With the recent birth of a son, my growing <a href="http://amartindesign.com/" target="_blank">design business</a>, as well as Social Media Club Lexington, which I founded in 2008, it&rsquo;s time for me to gear my focus elsewhere. Therefore it is not without some sadness that I am announcing my resignation from Awesome Inc. I am bowing out gracefully and leaving it in good hands as Dave McGee will be the new Social Media Director. He is very knowledgeable in the space and will do a mighty fine job.</p>
<p>Thank you all for the experiences and conversations. Please feel free to <a href="http://www.amartindesign.me/" target="_blank">stay in touch</a>.</p>
<p>Kindest Regards and Rule #4,</p>
