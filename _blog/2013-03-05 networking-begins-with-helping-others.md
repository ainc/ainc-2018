<p>I get asked this question a lot - &ldquo;Do you have any advice on how to get better at networking?&rdquo;. I recently received an email from a previous intern (team alpha member) posing the question. I&rsquo;ve copied the contents of my email response below. At some point, I&rsquo;ll likely turn this into a more organized blog post.</p>
<p>Hi &lt;name ommitted&gt;,  </p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out. Here&rsquo;s some feedback on networking:</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s definitely important to know the right people. It will benefit you a lot. But it&rsquo;s actually more important that people know you. We have a saying at Awesome Inc - &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not what you know - it&rsquo;s who you know, who knows you, and what they think of you.&rdquo; With that in mind, here are some tips:</p>
<ul><li>Relationships take time. We know a lot of people in Lexington now and they know us as well. But that wasn&rsquo;t the case 5 years ago. It took a lot of time.</li>
<li>Give before you get. <a href="http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2013/01/give-before-you-get.html" target="_blank">Read what Brad Feld thinks of this here</a>. Go into every conversation with one question in mind, What can I do for this person? Delivering on that will make them want to know you and they will think highly of you.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of failing at networking - you&rsquo;ll walk away from a lot of conversations thinking you just made a fool of yourself or looked like an idiot to the person you just met. It might even be true that you sounded dumb or said something that didn&rsquo;t make sense. That&rsquo;s ok though. Just like anything else, the more you practice it the better you get.</li>
<li>Use pivots / intros - If you can get someone at an event to intro you to someone you want to know, that is ideal. A lot of times this trick works - If you identify someone you want to meet, watch them interact with someone else at the event. Then simply go to the person they were just talking to and introduce yourself and say, &ldquo;I noticed you were talking to &lt;networking target&gt;, I&rsquo;d like to meet them. Could you introduce me.&rdquo; They will almost always say yes.</li>
<li>Have something of value to say / add - Be prepared to say something relevant and value add to the person you are approaching. Sometimes you can even do research ahead of time on the person you are approaching and understand their interests or needs.</li>
</ul><p>Hope this helps.</p>
