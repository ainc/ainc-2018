In August, [ten aspiring software developers](/blog/2016/09/29/bootcamp-update-halfway/) began a 500+ hour journey of intense, hands-on learning in Awesome Inc U's Web Developer Bootcamp. On Thursday, November 10th, this group will be [presenting their final projects](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/demo-day-web-developer-bootcamp-f16-cohort-tickets-28837502747), full-stack web applications, to a group of tech company executives, local software developers, and other members of the Lexington-area technology community.

The first program of its kind in Central Kentucky, the goal of the Web Developer Bootcamp is to help professionals transition into a new career in software development. This in turn helps local companies recruit local tech talent to support their growth, especially as tech moves beyond its own borders and becomes a bigger part of healthcare, manufacturing, finance, and beyond.

The public is invited to join us for the culmination of the Bootcamp program, a Demo Day on Thurs, Nov. 10th from 6-8pm at Awesome Inc. Free registration for the [Bootcamp Demo Day is available on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/demo-day-web-developer-bootcamp-f16-cohort-tickets-28837502747). Each member of the Bootcamp cohort will give a brief presentation of his or her final project, followed by an opportunity to experience each web application hands-on. We'll have light refreshments available throughout the evening. Projects include:

- Communication tool for daycare centers and parents
- Data tracking for local 5k running series
- Art history educational review tool
- Dating app based on movie preferences
- Sharing service for hobbyists and artisans to use private workshop spaces

We hope to see you on Thursday at the [Bootcamp Demo Day](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/demo-day-web-developer-bootcamp-f16-cohort-tickets-28837502747)!
