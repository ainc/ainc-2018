<p>The August 24th 5 Across event was yet another success (see <a href="http://www.5across.org/" target="_blank">www.5across.org</a>). The 5 pitches were:</p>
<p>Jon Stewart, pitched WeekendDestinations.com, which is a site that provides a centralized location where people, communities, businesses and organizations can share, search and retrieve information about the coming weekends.</p>
<p>Kenneth Johnson pitched Interstudent Market, which will offer college/graduate students e-commerce, primarily for textbooks, in a setting in which only other students may participate. This company will charge lower commissions (5-10% as opposed to 15%+ charged for books by Amazon), allow the creation of participant profiles with a rating system for transactions and limit participation to those with an .edu email address.</p>
<p>Jim Wombles presented Game Face, which will be a mobile smartphone app that makes it fun for users to connect, share, and play together at sporting events. Game Face provides sports fans with a way to interact in an online environment in a way that enhances the sports game they are watching or attending in the real world, providing them with a richer experience. Users will be able to check-in their location wherever they are so their friends can find them at the game, represented on a map overlay of the stadium and parking lot. When they check-in, a miniature version of their Facebook profile photo will be placed at their location, along with a bubbling blob of blue (for a Kentucky fan), around that image announcing their allegiance. Users will also have the ability to create their tailgate location (for football games), upload a picture of their tailgate crew, and share their location with friends on Facebook, making it easy for their friends to find them and also download the app.</p>
<p>Lawrence Rogers pitched Hidden Level Games, which is a &ldquo;Kingdoms of Eternity&rdquo; virtual trading card game. This is a modern version of the classic trading card game. The company will sell virtual cards and advertising space.</p>
<p>Johnny Williams and EJ Adams pitched #TeamFitness, which is a brand that&rsquo;s creating an online environment for members to log in, track, blog, and share their every day struggles and successes with other team members. Their staff provides daily information on the latest exercises, nutrition, and articles about the body. They give a high emphasis on member engagement with every member giving support and motivation to their fellow teammates. Once they establish their own #TeamFitness website, they will be offering online subscriptions as well as developing a mobile app that integrates with the website. As of now, the products that #TeamFitness offers are apparel and wristbands. #TeamFitness would like to branch out and expand their apparel line and add a few more accessories for the gym, like backpacks, gym towels, water bottles, etc.</p>
<p>The winner decided by the judges was Lawrence Rogers, with Hidden Level Games. Congratulations Lawrence! The audience winner (decided via text message) was Jim Wombles, with GameFace. Congratulations Jim. Your app will be awesome!</p>
<p>All the pitches were great! We&rsquo;re sure the judges had a hard time making their decision. Thanks to everyone who came out in support of this event. We were happy to see you and hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. If you missed the event, you can see videos of the pitches at 5across.org. We hope to see you at the October 26th event!</p>
