<p>I&rsquo;m working with some UK students to start a <a href="http://kykernel.com/2010/09/09/laundry-service-booming/" target="_blank">door-to-door laundry service</a>. When we got together for the first time a few months ago, I started to ask them all the things that we needed to do. There were plenty of things that came out from social media campaigns, to logos, business cards, a phone line, slogans, a domain name &amp; website, etc. I then asked them what the they thought most important things were that they should be doing. They started to prioritize the list to some degree, but for the most part they wanted to do all of it at once. <br/><br/>What the founders of a brand new laundry service weren&rsquo;t talking about: learning how to pick up, wash, dry, fold, and deliver laundry in large volumes efficiently and with minimal errors. <br/><br/>In case you didn&rsquo;t catch that, it was like a bunch of guys talking about starting their own pizza shop, and not even putting &ldquo;learn how to make really good pizza&rdquo; on their to do list, much less have it at the top, or even better, have it as THE ONLY THING THEY SHOULD SPEND THEIR TIME ON. <br/><br/>There, of course, is a case for marketing and carrying yourself in a way that you look legit. I even brought up the idea of having polo shirts with our logos on them (hey, even I can&rsquo;t resist talking about the fun stuff, I mean, it&rsquo;s fun!). When you dress not just professionally (which doesn&rsquo;t cost you anything, remember? You already have polo shirts and khakis in your closet) but are branded professionally (business card, logo on your shirt, slick website, 800 number, etc.) it adds a level of confidence to the salesman or other company representative that is trying to convince the bank, or customer, or supplier to do business with us. This confidence, coupled with branded, professional appearance of the company representative, indeed do combine to improve your chances of closing a sale, a supplier, a loan, etc. But given the limited nature of your most valuable resource, your time, I would allocate more of it to washing laundry or making pizzas than I would to installing phone lines and putting up a fancy website for a few important reasons. <br/><br/><br/><br/>First, the cool stuff is only skin deep and it doesn&rsquo;t take a very inquisitive person to see that you&rsquo;re just a shell. For example, simple questions like How many customers do you have? How long have you been washing laundry? What makes your pizza different or better than any other pizza would be fumbled and all the confidence that you (and that customer) had in your company thanks to your professional appearance would deflate faster than a popped balloon. <br/><br/>Second, the cool stuff is expensive. The other finite resource you have (after time) is money. You should spend as little of it as possible, and only on the things that matter most (duh). If it was your last 10 dollars (or the only 10 dollars you could possibly spend to get that pizza shop off the ground) what would you spend it on? A logo? A t-shirt? Fliers? No you&rsquo;d spend it on some stinking tomatoes, cheese, and dough! Now, you might not have only 10 dollars, but if you don&rsquo;t spend money on the most important things first, you might soon be left with only 10 bucks, and you can&rsquo;t buy a whole lot of pizza making ingredients with that. So you now have to get it right the first time (and since you&rsquo;ve never done it before, you probably won&rsquo;t). <br/><br/>Third, focusing on the important stuff gives you real confidence. Remember that confidence I talked about earlier? The kind you get by dressing up like you&rsquo;re a real business? Let me tell you two things about that lingering feeling of &ldquo;Are we actually legitimate&rdquo;? that you&rsquo;re looking for. One, it&rsquo;s probably not going to go away for years. My business partner has run a software business for over three years now and he still asks that question from time to time. Two, the fastest way to confidently be able to answer that question with a yes is by knowing that your company is THE BEST at what you do because the best ALWAYS stay in business. It may make you feel good to give someone a branded email address (lmurray@laundrypros.com) on a fancy business card, that directs them to a smooth website, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel nearly as good as it does to look the banker, the customer, the investor, the supplier in the eye and say, we&rsquo;ve washed 375 loads of laundry with an error rate of 2% and an average turnaround time of 2.5 hours, which is twice as accurate and three times as fast as our competitors, and five times more accurate and six times better than the national average¬ù. How much are they going to care about your business card or your logo then? Be the best first. Be the prettiest second. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Fourth, and finally, statistically speaking, your business will fail. You probably won&rsquo;t make it past your first year and you almost definitely won&rsquo;t make it past your third year so because the clock is ticking, focus on answering the questions that are crucial to your survival: Do people really value having their laundry done? Can we make the best pizza in town? Is it possible to return laundry faster and with a higher degree of accuracy than our competitors? If you spend half your time during that crucial first year filing a bunch of paperwork (so your business can be legit) and thinking up cute slogans you may run out of time and money and not even know if you actually failed! It very well could be that it&rsquo;s possible to kick the crap out of the local pizza shop because they are lazier and less creative than you are but you spent only 20 of those 60 hours per week you spent on your business actually making pizzas! <br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t be an idiot if want to start pizza shops, laundry companies, or car detailing businesses, spend 90% of your time actually making pizzas, washing laundry, or cleaning cars NOTHING ELSE. <br/><br/><br/><br/>This entire post presupposes that you know what your core business is. The guys from <a href="http://37signals.com/" target="_blank">37 signals</a> wrote a book called <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/" target="_blank">Rework</a> and one of the chapters talks about focusing on the hot dog. Using the analogy of starting a hot dog stand they talk about all the decisions that you have to make: color of the umbrella, types of condiments, type of cart, location in the city, bun varieties, etc. There&rsquo;s a LOT to think about. However, if you don&rsquo;t have a <i>hot dog</i>, you don&rsquo;t have a hot dog <i>stand</i> so focus on the hot dog first and foremost. <br/><br/><br/><br/>This is simple for a pizza shop or a laundry business perhaps (unless the pizza shop is selling the most fun atmosphere, or the hottest waitresses and not necessarily the best pizza) but it might be much more difficult for other businesses. But knowing what your core business is - your hot dog - is the first thing you need to clarify before putting together the list of the dozens of other things you have on your mind about what needs to happen to get your idea off the ground.</p>
