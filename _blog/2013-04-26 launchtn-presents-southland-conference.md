<p><a href="http://launchtn.org/" target="_blank">LaunchTN</a> is excited to announce Southland, a conference geared toward showcasing the Southeast&rsquo;s startup scene and culture, will be held in Nashville June 12th-13th and will bring together 500+ entrepreneurs, investors, thought leaders and other innovators with the goal of connecting some of the Southeast&rsquo;s best early-stage companies with investors from across the country.</p>
<p>In addition to leading national/regional venture capital firms and regional angel funds (over 40 outside investment firms/funds committed so far), we&rsquo;ll have thought leaders from tech media such as Pando Daily, Fortune.com and CNN.com, tech firms such as IBM, Twitter, and Foursquare, along with accelerator leaders and mentors from 500 Startups and the Startup America.</p>
<p>A special part of Southland will include &ldquo;Startup Village&rdquo; where a maximum of 70 companies will have the opportunity to exhibit their startups. 25 of those companies will be chosen to have the opportunity to pitch their idea in front of the attendees. The entrepreneurs who are selected to attend will be chosen by a panel of judges that includes venture capital firms and angels. We would love your help in spreading the word in order to encourage great companies to apply.</p>
