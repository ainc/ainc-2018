<p>This month, Awesome Inc U launches the first semester of our <a href="http://www.awesomeincu.com/curriculum/#academy" target="_blank">Academy Program</a>, with ten students aged nine through sixteen.  The Academy meets in the evening twice a week, from September through December.  It offers advanced instruction for middle and high school students who want to not only improve their coding skills, but also use their skills to develop software products for the real world.</p>
<p>The Academy uses a blended model of instruction and project work, so that once the students learn basic concepts, they can take the initiative on projects that appeal to them.  Over the course of the season, students will work on several small projects to help them master various important coding skills and disciplines.</p>

<p>Students get plenty of one-on-one time with Academy instructors and TA’s.</p>
<p>One of the Academy’s strengths is that the instruction is not just high-quality, it is also very personalized.  The small class size of the Academy will allow students to have plenty of one-on-one time with the instructors.  In addition to the lead instructor, there will always be teaching assistants in attendance to assist students with any questions they may have.</p>
<p>Students will also work on one large project throughout the semester.  This project will be the “capstone” of the course, and each student will be able to create a project that appeals to his or her own interests.  Whether a game in Unity, a beautiful website, a cool mobile app, or something else entirely, the students will end the season with a completed project that shows off their creativity and coding skills.</p>
<p>Learning computer science concepts and programming principles aren’t the only things students will get to do at the Academy, though.  They’ll also be able to meet with professional programmers from local technology companies to learn more about the working life of a programmer. Our vision for Awesome Inc U is to build a nationally-competitive software development workforce here in Kentucky. This won’t happen overnight, so foundational initiatives like the Academy are important steps toward realizing that goal over the next ten to twenty years.</p>
