By Nick Such

Today, a new cohort completed our latest Web Developer Bootcamp (our 15th!), and we are excited for you to see how far these allstars have come.

We're always impressed by the backgrounds of our learners before bootcamp, and this group doesn't disappoint. They've previously worked in food service, music, videography, education, and more. And now they know how to turn ideas into plans, plans into code, and code into software soluions for real-world problems.

This group has also accomplished something special among our grads: they're only the second group to complete the entire program remotely. This takes a particular type of dedication, while fostering remote communication skills that we've seen become essential for our recent grads. Now, even working for a local company often means collaborating remotely with colleagues and customers.

## The Demo List

Nine students, now developers, are presented at Demo Day. Hereâ€™s the crew:
