<p>Team Alpha attended a social media training by Awesome Inc.&rsquo;s social media director, David McGee. Topics included the history of social media to tips on how to use it effectively.</p>
<p>The talk began by discussing how information was shared before social media to demonstrate how much easier and better it is for businesses today. There have been over 7000 days of the Internet since the first website went online, and it has transformed PR from Public Relations to Personal Relationships.</p>
<p>At first advertising was from one to many, and the opinions of the many did not matter. Now, thanks to social media, many can interact with many, and the voice of the consumer matters. Cory Doctorow describes the idea of whuffie in his book &ldquo;Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom&rdquo;. Whuffie is the currency of social influence. Since anyone can use social media, we all have the power of influence. But just like any relationships, the ones created by social media take time to develop, so don&rsquo;t be too over eager to close the deal too soon.</p>
<p>McGee provided tips for using social media successfully. It is important to always have owned media. A business should always direct their social media back to a website they own, so as things like Myspace come and go, they still have a place for costumers to find them.</p>
<p>Another tip is to avoid automation, as it causes some things to be lost in translation. You can link sites like Facebook and Twitter so posting on one automatically posts to the other, but you lose the nuances of both. For example, on Twitter there is a hashtag #MM, which means Music Monday. Facebook users may not be familiar with the meaning, so it is not good idea for that tweet to be posted on Facebook.</p>
<p>Finally, for people not sure how to use Twitter, there are two good ways to get started. Both are meant to get the user invested in using and checking his or her Twitter. The first method is to following interesting people you don&rsquo;t know and try to get them to respond to you. The second is to find three friends you care about on Twitter and respond back and forth with them.</p>
<p>Using social media can be a great tool for a business to interact with customers. It is easy to do by keeping a few tips in mind. David McGee can be reached <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/@davemc9ee" target="_blank">@davemc9ee</a>.</p>
