<p>Zig Ziglar, famous author and motivational speaker said, “You can have everything in life you want, if you will just help other people get what they want.”</p>
<p>This is advice that every entrepreneur should take.  I’ve been spending a lot of time lately trying to get inside my customer’s head &ndash; actually walk in their shoes, sit in their desks, relate to their problems, experience their joy.  For most people, myself included, this doesn’t come all that easy.  To truly understand another person and the way they think is against our natural self-seeking behavior.  However, it’s often the key to building and then selling a successful product or service.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that the best sales people let the customer do most of the talking.  They just react to what the customer says and adapt their pitch accordingly - “so safety matters to you, well this car has a 5 star safety rating”, or “you’re on a budget, I totally understand.  This car gets efficient gas mileage”.  The only way you can read the customer and react appropriately is if you actually LISTEN, relate to that person, and then give that person what they said they want.  So, really it all starts with listening.  In order to help others get what they want, you have to be an excellent listener.</p>
<p>The very best entrepreneurs are often the very best listeners.</p>
