<p>Eight students from Leadership Lexington shadowed Awesome Inc on Tuesday afternoon in an effort to learn more about entrepreneurship. What better way to learn about entrepreneurship than to start a company? The students participated in a miniature <a href="http://lexington.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a> at Awesome Inc that culminated with each team developing a tear sheet for their startup (also knows as a one pager). The day began with listening to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1QWtgPgqZg" target="_blank">The Song</a> (Numb/Encore by JayZ/ Linkin Park), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5YJfPBqPNE" target="_blank">The Other Song</a> (Remember the Name by Fort Minor), and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMt8ZYaJKmA" target="_blank">#3</a> (Go it Alone by Beck) for inspiration. Next there was an introduction on what entrepreneurship is and what it takes to start a company.</p>
<p>The goal of the day was to develop a one pager on the company they decided to launch. After reviewing what a one pager is, they learned how important it is to pick the right people with whom to work. They wrote down each person&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses to help them choose team members who would complement their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Next the students called out ideas for companies. Of the fifteen proposed ideas, the students narrowed it down to three and then chose which idea they wanted to work on. After developing their ideas and learning how to use Google docs, each team created a one pager. Check out their one pagers below.</p>
