<p>It was a frigid February day for the first 5 Across of the year but we had some hot pitches to keep us warm. The blinds went down and the lights were dimmed, the perfect kick off atmosphere. After the judges intro, the first team gave their pitch.</p><p>Katy Brown karate chopped her way to the stage to pitch KidBiz. KidBiz connects parents to special kid related deals. Next came <a href="http://hahndigital.com" target="_blank">Hahn Digital</a>, an advertising platform that modernized radio ads. </p><p>University of Kentuckyâ€™s very own Diante Elcock &amp; Adam Campbell pitched Scentple afterwards. Scentple prints various scents for perfume and cologne, not the first scent related pitch at 5 Across. </p><p><a href="http://ultimateangler.co" target="_blank">Ultimate Angler</a> pitched a service that brings together fishermen and customers making fishing trips easier. Race Assured rounded out the pitches with their blood tests for thoroughbred injury prevention. Each pitch represented different parts of Lexington, from UK to race horses, but only one could win.</p><p>Race Assured took home the $500 prize and will go on to the 5 Across Finals in December. Keep a look out for the next 5 Across in April!</p>
