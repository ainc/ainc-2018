<p>Grant Weherley recently won first place in the the undergraduate business concept competition at <a href="http://www.ideastateu.com/" target="_blank">Idea State U</a>, Kentucky&rsquo;s statewide idea and business competition. This competition promotes entrepreneurship and innovation by rewarding the best idea with a cash prize. Prizes are awarded to groups/individuals who present the best new business concepts and plans. His winning idea is a business he started recently called<a href="http://www.controlmyadhd.com/" target="_blank">Control My ADHD</a>.</p>
<p>Some time ago, Grant Weherley noticed a rather large problem. He was trying to find resources to help individuals cope with their ADHD, but he found that all that was available were mere snippets of information sprinkled across countless websites. This information was hard to get to; sometimes in blog posts, sometimes in excerpts from books or magazines, or in lengthy webinars. All sources for the information relied on these clunky, unappealing formats which are rather ineffective and unpleasant for someone with ADHD. Grant set out to create a resource for those who wanted this extremely helpful information about dealing with ADHD symptoms in a format that would be, &ldquo;quick, painless, and informative, and maybe even a bit fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To that end, Grant created the website, Control My ADHD. The website offers many tools, tailored specifically for assisting adults who suffer from ADHD. When asked if he would consider expanding the site to cover children and adolescents as well, he was said it was a possibility for the future. According to Grant, Control My ADHD provides users with &ldquo;the best strategies for utilizing their strengths to overcome their ADHD symptoms in interactive, visually engaging formats.&rdquo; The blog area of the website is open to everyone, and is being updated with free information on a regular basis. The video area is for members only. A newly discounted $25 subscription fee gives users access to a full ADHD mastery video course, which guides users through a series of lessons with new content on a weekly basis. A free sample video is available on the website, along with other useful information.
