<p>On a dark and dreary Halloween night, one lady’s day was brightened by a couple 5spot do-gooders. This young lady, Gabrielle, helped an older woman get something out from underneath her car in the Kroger parking lot. Then she walked into Kroger as if nothing happened. The best part about it was that she didn’t even think twice to help the woman. Here at 5spot, we believe that no act of kindness should go unnoticed, so we decided to do something about it. </p>
<p><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></p>
<p>While she was walking to her car after grocery shopping, our very own David Booth surprised her with a warm greeting and handshake. David explained to Gabrielle that he had seen her help the elderly woman, and he then handed her a $50 Kroger gift card for her next trip to the grocery store.  Her surprised reaction was very genuine, expletives included. The lesson of the day is to be kind because no act of kindness is ever wasted, and you just might be rewarded for your kind deeds by a red bearded guy wearing an unbelievably soft t-shirt.</p>
