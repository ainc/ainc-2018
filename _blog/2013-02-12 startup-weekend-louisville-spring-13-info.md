<p>We&rsquo;re pleased to announce that Louisville&rsquo;s second Startup Weekend will be held <strong>March 1-3, 2013</strong>, at JCTC&rsquo;s new<em> Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship Center</em>.</p>
<p><strong>What is Startup Weekend?</strong></p>
<p>All Startup Weekend events follow the same basic model: anyone is welcome to pitch their startup idea and receive feedback from their peers. Teams organically form around the top ideas (as determined by popular vote) and then it&rsquo;s a 54 hour frenzy of business model creation, coding, designing, and market validation. The weekends culminate with presentations in front of local entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for critical feedback.</p>
<p><strong>The Details</strong></p>
<p>Startup Weekend Louisville kicks off Friday evening, March 1st, 2013. Your ticket lets you pitch an idea, or join another team. You&rsquo;ll have access to food, wifi, and a set of business mentors with broad experience. You&rsquo;ll work with your team throughout the day on Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday evening a panel of judges picks the winning team. It&rsquo;s a hands-on experience in product development and customer development, and a lot of fun.</p>
