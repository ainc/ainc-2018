<p>Try using the word &ldquo;homesteading&rdquo; in front of most investors. It&rsquo;s not one that inspires confidence in those you&rsquo;re pitching to, but in my case, it&rsquo;s the only word that applies.</p>
<p><a href="http://earthineer.com/" target="_blank">Earthineer</a> is a network designed exclusively for homesteading and sustainable living that allows people to socialize, find experts, and trade.</p>
<p>Many investors think of a &ldquo;homesteader&rdquo; as some guy with bad teeth and an unkempt beard&hellip;someone who is distilling moonshine back in the hills, and eeking a meager existance out of a mean soil.</p>
<p>In actuality, the word &ldquo;homesteader&rdquo; is having a bit of a Rennaissance. It&rsquo;s even taking place in urban environments, and the title &ldquo;urban homesteader&rdquo; has been used to described homesteading activities in suburban/urban environments. Chickens are going into suburban backyards, yards are being transformed into edible landscapes, and beehives are going on the top of city buildings.</p>
<p>My point is this – I recognize that I often have a hurdle to overcome when pitching Earthineer. I have to describe the topics, and I have to be appeal to the audience I&rsquo;m pitching to. If I&rsquo;m lucky, there will be people in the audience for whom the idea actually resonates.</p>
<p>I participated in the <a href="http://cob.nku.edu/inkubator.html" target="_blank">INKUBATOR</a> program this last year. It offered all of the classes and mentors that you&rsquo;d expect out of an accelerator, and it was my first real introduction to the vibrant startup communities that are taking place in Cincinnati, Louisville, and Lexington.</p>
<p>Through contacts that I made during the INKUBATOR, I met Warren Nash, and eventually found myself at the 5 Across competition on October 31st.</p>
<p>By time that I pitched at <a href="http://www.5across.org/" target="_blank">5 Across</a>, I had already given this pitch twice before&hellip;but I was never more nervous than when I pitched that night. Sitting at the judges table was none other than Brad Feld. I had known that he was in town (I was going to attend one of his talks in Lexington), but I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated that he&rsquo;d be there at 5 Across as a judge.</p>
<p>My pitch went well though, and as I passed by the judge&rsquo;s table to sit down, I could see that several of them were looking at Earthineer (some of them even signed up during the event – even Brad).</p>
<p>It was humbling&hellip;and exciting.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I had the opportunity to speak with one of the other judges. It turned out that he raised chickens and ducks. We talked for a long time&hellip;long after most of the crowd had left the Awesome Inc space.</p>
<p>He wound up being an investor, and was my advocate when I went on to pitch to the Bluegrass Angels.</p>
<p>I won $500 at the Oct. 31st pitch, and $1,000 at the finals.</p>
<p>So&hellip;what did I use the prize money for? It&rsquo;s likely a boring use of those winnings, but I used them to pay my monthly operational costs – Rackspace, Embedly, SendGrid, etc.</p>
<p>I admit to liking competitions&hellip;and the prize money was much-needed&hellip;but the value of prize money paled in comparison with the networking opportunities that I received as a result of pitching at 5 Across.</p>
<p>Above all else, pitching is about finding advocates.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the true value of the 5 Across competition and everything that Awesome Inc provides to Lexington - the opportunity to engage and participate in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.</p>
