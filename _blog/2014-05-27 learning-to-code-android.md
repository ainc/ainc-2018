<p>After a few months of interning at Awesome Inc, I thought I’d try my hand at something most people in the building already knew: coding. But first, let me tell you about myself. I was a history major, where opportunities to code are about as nonexistent as my admissions letter to Hogwarts. My only other experience remotely relevant to coding was programming the thermostat in my house. It didn’t take long at Awesome Inc for coding to strike my curiosity –I saw people much younger and older than myself hunched over their keyboard with their gaze completely locked into the screen, seemingly pounding away producing colorful nonsense on the monitor. I couldn’t make sense of anything until the final product revealed some game, app, or website. Coding didn’t seem like my forte, but I figured I’d try my hand at it. One weekend I had the opportunity to attend an Awesome Inc U course for Android. I figured the best-case scenario was I’d become a coding prodigy and live a lifestyle similar to Tony Stark. The worst-case was a Saturday wasted in frustration, torture, and misery. The course advertised “No experience needed” and I was determined to test the veracity of that statement to the fullest. </p>
<p>I arrived early Saturday morning with my other classmates eager to get started. I sat myself down in the seat furthest back so no one looking ahead would see my screen and judge my coding incompetence. We dove right in and soon enough I was entrenched in an Android maze of code. I typed away and the language became more and more familiar within a matter of minutes.  I double-checked my code in my virtual phone. It was amazing: I had functional (yet highly simple) app stacking text on top of each other! I left for lunch with renewed confidence. As most experienced coders know, this confidence was about to be shattered with a new challenge. Our new task as a class was to make a text-input system that would reproduce words onto a list. With the same vigor as earlier, I pounded away at my keyboard producing line after line of colorful code. Before I knew it, there was only one color highlighting my entire script: the red lines running underneath everything. The program did not offer a proposed solution to my errors or even attempt to decipher my intentions. I sat drowning in my shame with my confidence zapped. I mustered the courage to raise my hand and ask for help. Chris Allen, our instructor, quickly skimmed over my script. With immediate detection, he added a bracket to the beginning of my code and replaced an “O” with a zero. I was humbled, but my confidence had been restored. I ran the code onto my emulator and it was a miracle. I entered text into the box and each word popped up below. Each time I pressed “Enter” I was overcome with a sense of joy and pride.</p>

<p>In those few hours I developed a deep appreciation for those who were “code literate.” Coding required discipline and creativity, focus and imagination, success and failure. It was emotionally and mentally exhausting, but seeing those words appear in list form made all my efforts worth it. My point is, if I can do it, you certainly can. I have even moved beyond programming a thermostat with some small changes to the app I made in class that day and I look forward to learning new coding languages. Coding makes everyone capable of innovative, fulfilling, and fantastic work. Isn’t that all we should seek in an opportunity? </p>
