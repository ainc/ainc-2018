<p>The <a href="http://lexingtonventureclub.com/about/" target="_blank">Lexington Venture Club </a>sponsored a competition on March 20th, 2013 between four University of Kentucky MBA Student entrepreneur teams at the Hyatt Hotel in downtown Lexington. At the competition, the four teams had the opportunity to pitch their ideas to members of the Lexington Venture Club to receive feedback and for a chance to win $500. Before the competition got underway, Zach Pennington and Josh Strange, the founders of <a href="https://giftpool.co/" target="_blank">GiftPool</a>, who won the most recent <a href="http://www.5across.org/" target="_blank">5 Across</a>, were given a chance to pitch to the venture club members for feedback. 5 Across is also sponsored by the Lexington Venture Club.</p>
<p>The four competing teams were:</p>
<p>• EARly Tag: A group that plans to implement ear tag technology to monitor the movement and health of livestock.</p>
<p>• Precision Medical: A group that is introducing a new suction bulb device for patients after having certain surgeries.</p>
<p>• Integral Solutions: A group planning to utilize integral lens array technology to cut down on the growing problem of counterfeit drug production.</p>
<p>• TerraCast Technologies: A group planning to use switchgrass to help with land reclamation and butanol bio-fuel production.</p>
<p>TerraCast Technologies won the pitch competition. Their plan consists of land reclamation using switchgrass, harvesting it and using the biomass to produce an acetone, butanol, ethanol mixture for bio-fuel. This will potentially create a new cash crop for Kentucky, and the adoption of butanol as a bio-fuel is expected increase rapidly. TerraCast is made up of MBA students Jordan Denny, Lee Goatley, Jarrod Willis, and Jordan Laycock. The technology they plan to implement is based on the work of UK professors Sue Nokes and Michael Montross, who won a seven million dollar grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for their work with switchgrass.</p>
