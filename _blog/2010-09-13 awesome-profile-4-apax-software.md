<p>APAX Software (<a href="http://apaxsoftware.com/" target="_blank">apaxsoftware.com</a>) sells custom web and mobile software applications to small and medium regional businesses. Their goal is to be the first name that comes to mind when someone needs custom software.</p>
<p>So far APAX has developed over a dozen iPhone apps and is becoming a leader in mobile app development. Currently they are working on an iPhone app for the public arts including a map to artwork with accompanying descriptions. Users can also check in at the sites and get points for viewing the art.</p>

<p>APAX Software employs over ten people, including owners Brian Raney, Justin Raney, Matt Smith, and Ryan Hunter, project manager Keith Kurzendoerfer, sales representative Luke Murray, developers Nick Profitt, Josh Strange, Josh Hall, David Sloan, and Tyler Green, and graphic designer Jason Corder. The owners started the company in 2007 because they were friends with software backgrounds who wanted to choose who they work with, what they work on, and how they complete their work. Choosing who to surround themselves with has been their most important decision as entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>A challenge of running their own business has been the responsibility of making enough money to pay their salaries and look after their employees. They compare adding value to their company to sitting at the right table in poker. There&rsquo;s always the possibility of bad luck, but they know what they are good at and picked a market that is growing and expanding.</p>
