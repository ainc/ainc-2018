<p><em>Lessons from Dr. Zurbuchen</em></p>
<p>In early September I had the pleasure of hearing from an entrepreneurial leader from Ann Arbor, MI.  <a href="http://innovateblue.umich.edu/blog/" target="_blank">Thomas Zurbuchen</a> is the Senior Counselor for <a href="http://innovateblue.umich.edu" target="_blank">Entrepreneurship at University of Michigan</a>.</p>
<p>With his team and partners, he has built an incredible entrepreneurship ecosystem at UM.  Here are my top four takeaways from his talk that can be implemented / mirrored for us here at UK:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Engage more students - there are so many ideas on UK’s campus from our most valuable resource, our students.  Get them involved in the entrepreneurial community, even if it is just on the surface at first.  The highest potential ones will seek out more deeply rooted engagement.  Zurbuchen told a story of how he paid a small group of students $5 for every idea they could find on campus and set a goal of finding 1,000 ideas to participate in a contest.  It took the students a while to reach the goal, but they eventually made it.  “It was the hardest $5,000 the students will ever earn,” says Zurbuchen.  This resulted in an annual pitch-competition, <a href="http://1000pitches.com/" target="_blank">1000 pitches</a>.  I’m thinking about doing something similar at UK.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engage more of the community - Zurbuchen said that the majority of the contributors to the programs at UM are from outside the university.  This includes local entrepreneurs, business owners, investors, service providers.  Brad Feld discusses this component of building a successful entrepreneurial community in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem-ebook/dp/B008UV826U" target="_blank">Startup Communities</a> as one of the four parts of the <a href="http://www.feld.com/archives/tag/boulder-thesis" target="_blank">Boulder Thesis</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create scalable solutions - just like anything, you have to start small.  But it’s important to focus on ideas that can scale to something very big.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The metric that matters for the university entrepreneurial program at UM is “shots on goal”.  This is interpreted as opportunities that are being pursued, both by entrepreneurs (students &amp; faculty), as well as projects that might help the startup community.  For example, a new startup that 2 students in their dorm room are working on counts as a shot on goal.  So does a new entrepreneurial initiative such as a pitch contest that is being organized.  Make that metric go up and the program is succeeding.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>Overall, lots to learn from Zurbuchen and everything that he has accomplished at UM.  <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0Bx_Q0BT9EMjONFNxQ2tIbWdsOUhwVk4wUHcxRTRhdXFtUUo4/edit" target="_blank">Here is a copy of his pitch deck</a> with additional info and tips.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jamie Leddin for convincing Dr. Zurbuchen to visit us in Lexington!</p>
