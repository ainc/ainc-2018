<p>The most competitive and innovative ideas of the year got a chance to compete once more on December 5th, at what is now known as the largest 5 Across event in history. With the spirit of the holidays in the air, it was clear that this 5 Across would be unlike any other.<b><br/></b></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="677" data-orig-width="508"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/e83d8dce8f30762321beedaa55590599/tumblr_inline_pktnda3JG01spm8pc_540.jpg" data-orig-height="677" data-orig-width="508"/></figure><p>200 people excitedly shuffled into the historic Kentucky Theatre— some regulars, and others not knowing exactly what awaits them.</p><p>As the chatter died down and everyone took a seat, the winners from each 2018 5 Across event prepared to give their final pitch to compete for $4000. </p><p>First up were February winners <a href="http://www.pascaltags.co/" target="_blank">Pascal Tags</a>, who created an alternative solution for businesses facing unorganized inventory, overstocking, and out-of-stocking. The company’s now patented, battery-free tags give business owners a cheaper solution to tracking items. Since winning 2017 Startup Weekend Louisville, this company had a one-of-a-kind idea from the start.</p><p>Next was Chez, a company that promises a gourmet meal right in the comfort of your own home. Users can down the Chez app and hire a chef to cook a meal at home. While the service is aiming for larger, denser cities, it is on the way to transforming what we think of as “eating in.” </p><p>Wild Dog Physics gives cancer patients a cost-efficient and timely treatment option opposed to traditional radiation therapy. To bypass the complicated nature of many radiation treatments, Wild Dog Physics has developed hardware and software that combines all the necessary pieces for cancer treatment into one lightweight, compliant device.</p><p>Next was April winner <a href="http://moolathon.com/" target="_blank">Moolathon</a>, an app that monetizes a user’s fitness for a cause through virtual 5Ks, individual campaigns, and gyms that are similar to Pokemon gyms, where users can compete and interact with other fitness enthusiasts, all while supporting the charity of their choice. </p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="677" data-orig-width="1015"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/9a8d6f0148e6c1dc85694e17a0d9b095/tumblr_inline_pktne4Ac9a1spm8pc_540.jpg" data-orig-height="677" data-orig-width="1015"/></figure><p>The last pitch of the night went to<a href="https://www.ezgig.work/" target="_blank"> EZGig</a>, a company that is the Lyft or Uber of the workforce. Employees can sign up on the EZGig app, upload a resume, and get hired for events or temporary positions. EZGig users will then get rated after a job is complete, which will give them an upperhand for future jobs.</p><p>Once the pitches were complete and the judges went to deliberate, attendees got a chance to mull over seeing Kentucky’s most promising entrepreneurs.</p><p>As the judges made their reemerged and a decision was made, it was time to announce the winner of the 2018 5 Across Finals.</p><p>An eager drumroll reverberated through the audience as EZGig was announced the AwesomeVote app winner.</p><p>A slightly louder drumroll from the audience echoed throughout the theater and Moolathon was announced the second place winner of $1000.</p><p>Finally the moment everyone had waited all year for was here, and we’re not talking Christmas morning. With the help of boisterous cheers and the clanging of noisemakers throughout the theater, Pascal Tags was officially announced the winner of the 5 Across Finals!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="677" data-orig-width="1015"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f40f3501e3e7042b29cdfc1dbba1a3cf/tumblr_inline_pktnegXrYw1spm8pc_540.jpg" data-orig-height="677" data-orig-width="1015"/></figure><p>Join us February where we begin a brand new year of discovering exhilarating, innovative startups!</p>
