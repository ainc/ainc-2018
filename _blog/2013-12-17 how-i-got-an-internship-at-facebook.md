<p>After spending the summer interning at Facebook, I get asked on a pretty regular basis “So what do I need to do in order to get a job at one of those big tech companies?” I don’t mind the question, but I’m not always sure they’re ready for the answer.</p>
<p>Let me back up a minute. My name is Tommy Crush, I’m a senior at UK, and I’ll be going on full-time as a software engineer at Facebook next summer after successfully interning there last year. About two years ago, I got involved with Awesome Inc and started a company with my cofounder David Booth. I was the sole engineer, and David handled business development.</p>
<p>I’m not going to detail what we built, or how we did it, because it’s not relevant to how I got the internship. The only important part of that story can be summed up in another way: “I proved that I knew what I was doing by actually doing it.” In terms of self-marketing, that concept is the single most powerful straightforward no-explanation-needed statement that one could possibly make. And it worked.</p>
<p>I’m the first to admit that I’m not smartest software engineer at UK; in fact I’m not even a computer science major. But I’m likely one of the few students who could claim “I was the sole engineer for a company that had real code, real clients, and real problems.” Awesome Inc provided the entrepreneurial community to keep me going when the going got rough.</p>
<p>So how do you position yourself to beat out Ivy League students applying at top tech companies? Do something they’re not: build. Sure, take your studies seriously; but your classes alone will not get you there. Get involved with an entrepreneurial community. Seek out opportunities to solve real-world problems. Write real code. Find something you’re passionate about. </p>
