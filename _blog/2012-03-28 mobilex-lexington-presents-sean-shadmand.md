<p>In today&rsquo;s online marketplace Sean Shadmand says widespread use of multi-device technology will affect the way businesses and web operators should interact with their users. At MobileX Lexington Sean hopes to expose the difficulties and solutions of a multi-device world and bring awareness to the changing environment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, as a technology driven group of users and businesses, have finally gotten comfortable with understanding how to navigate a user from our email, to Facebook, to our site and backtracking systems, API and social networks are plentiful. But, all that we know was learned in the singular-device world of the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his MobileX presentation, &ldquo;The Loop&rsquo;: How You&rsquo;re Losing Customers,&rsquo; Shadmand will explain how the new viral loop in a multi-device world will work and which technological platforms and devices are best suited to tackle the right problems.</p>
<p>Dubbed a &quot;strategic genius&rdquo; by the Washington Post, Shadmand is currently the president and co-founder of the Socialize, Inc., which operates as a consulting and software development company that develops mobile websites and applications for businesses worldwide. However, Shadmand is no newbie to start-up businesses and mobile entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Shadmand began his career in start-ups working with one of the largest social networks in the world,<a href="http://www.tagged.com/" target="_blank">Tagged.com</a>, in its early stages. Shortly thereafter, he created an online recipe site dedicated to his mother,<a href="http://familyoven.com/" target="_blank">Familyoven.com</a>.</p>
<p>In 2008, Shadmand co-founded PointAbout, Inc., a mobile consulting firm based out of Washington DC that specializes in IPhone and Android based development, and in 2010 he was the visionary behind <a href="http://www.appmakr.com/" target="_blank">AppMakr</a>, a do-it-yourself platform that allows users to create their own native apps and sell them in the App Store.</p>
<p>Shadmand has also appeared on Bloomberg TV as a guest expert and has been featured in The Washington Post, Wired, ABC News, Entrepreneur Magazine, FastCompany and TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Previous presenter and co-founder at Socialize, Inc., Daniel Odio, introduced Shadmand to the success of the MobileX team and its events. Shadmand says, &ldquo;I am excited to participate in its success, and to share knowledge gained from our tribes and tribulations as we grew as contenders in the mobile space.&rdquo;</p>
