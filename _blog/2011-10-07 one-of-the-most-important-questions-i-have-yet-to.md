<p>When I was running bookexchange.com as an undergrad I talked to lots of potential investors or business folks in general that just wanted to give advice and/or see if what we were doing was a good deal to invest in or not. We got a TON of questions and pieces of advice. Some of it was random (never will forget the French guy that was convinced we were the next Google&hellip;that will go down in history) but eventually we saw plenty of patterns and after awhile there were few suggestions, questions, and pieces of advice and feedback.</p>
<p>THE question that I didn&rsquo;t hear but was waiting for an investor not just to ask about, but to grill us on was&hellip;&ldquo;How hard are you working on this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, I realize this is a somewhat vague question to ask, but as a future investor (hopefully) I will hit this question from every possible angle before leaving it alone. And I&rsquo;ll probably come back to it a couple more times after that – just to make sure the stories are consistent.</p>
<p>People were curious if <a href="http://www.bookexchange.com/" target="_blank">bookexchange.com</a> was a good idea or not. What our margins were, who our competition was, what the environment was like at our schools, etc. These are all important questions yes, but if we&rsquo;re not willing to work our asses off to make sure this thing not only succeeds but that we <strong>dominate</strong>the market then someone else will come along and beat us if it&rsquo;s actually a great idea.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to make sure to ask this especially when I have college students or any other entrepreneurs whom I suspect have other obligations outside of their business (i.e. asking questions like &lsquo;what are you doing to afford to live?&rsquo;). Was bookexchange.com a good idea? I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;our team never gave it 100% for any length of time. One of our competitors – <a href="http://www.chegg.com/" target="_blank">chegg.com</a> – had an estimated valuation of around $1billion&hellip;last year. These guys (Osman and Aayush) started pretty much the same time we did. I doubt they were smarter than us. I know they weren&rsquo;t older than us. What they DEFINITELY was more committed than we were.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, luck and circumstance and a proper business model in the right place at the right time are all important – but I will never let anentrepreneur out of my office that I might be investing money into without grilling the heck out of him about his commitment to the company.</p>
<p>You can be lazy and/or do your business as a side hobby, but I want to know the time commitment you&rsquo;re making to the project and the significance it has in your life up front if I&rsquo;m going to invest in it and you should too if you&rsquo;re expecting it to go anywhere in a reasonable amount of time. This will be one of the biggest deciding factors in whether or not I&rsquo;ll end up investing&hellip;because it would have been one of the biggest deciding factors in the financial success or failure of bookexchange.com,regardless of whether we were successful in raising funding.</p>
