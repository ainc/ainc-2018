<p>Awesome Inc just returned from our annual retreat to the Smoky Mountains.  Each year our team takes three days to break away from the daily grind and step back to look at the bigger picture or deeper purpose of our companies.  The trip includes a solid mix of strategy sessions, theoretical sessions, and fun activities.  </p>
<p><br/>This year’s retreat, appropriately named the “AweSummit”, had a focus on “Why we do what we do?”</p>
<p>It’s not a stretch to say that most entrepreneurs are a little bit insane.  Actually, it’s probably not a stretch to say that ALL entrepreneurs are CERTIFIABLY insane&hellip;and the more successful the entrepreneur, the more insane behavior you’ll observe.  Entrepreneurs have something that often appears to be illogical driving them to move forward.  An outsider could easily conclude they are out of touch with reality, that their confidence, optimism &amp; persistence are completely unjustified.</p>
<p>Take for example the story of Pandora Radio.  Founder, Tim Westergren got rejected from investors over 300 times.  His company was on the brink of death.  He spent  years working for free and somehow managed to convince others to work for free as well.  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pandora-story-2011-6" target="_blank">More on the Pandora story here, if you’re interested</a>.</p>
<p>Sound insane?  Probably so.  But I'd argue that an entrepreneur's appearance of insanity is actually just the manifestation of misunderstood <span id="docs-internal-guid-7791f051-9f85-5373-2246-485daa3fcb56">passion (<a href="http://ctt.ec/J7nDj" target="_blank">click to tweet</a>)</span>.  And it’s that passion that keeps entrepreneurs going long after they should logically give up on a business.  Passion is what drives their persistence, tenacity, and self confidence to something that looks like insanity.  And at the core of that passion exists “The Why” for their business.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the responses from the retreat when Awesome Inc entrepreneurs were asked, “Why do you do what you do?”</p>
<p>&hellip;because my passion in life is to help kids with more struggles than me reach their full potential.</p>
<p>&hellip;because things on the internet can be better&hellip;and for those things that CAN be better, we think they SHOULD be better.</p>
<p>&hellip;because people die unexpected deaths and my product can save their life.</p>
<p>&hellip;because I want to empower people to make informed choices even though they may be misled by other organizations.</p>
<p>&hellip;because I want my family to be given more opportunities than I had.</p>
<p>&hellip;because I want to help people learn a skill that enables them to turn their own passions into reality.</p>
<p><br/>So, if you're thinking about starting a company, here&rsquo;s a question to help you get started -</p>
<p>What are you insane about?  For what reason, what &lsquo;why&rsquo;, would you work on something so relentlessly that others might think you&rsquo;re crazy?  </p>
<p>Only you can decide, but until you do, you&rsquo;re not likely to last long on the crazy roller coaster that is starting a business.</p>
