<p>Today we turned five.  Jimmy Valvano would be proud of me today, because I’ll have no problem laughing, thinking and crying all in the same day.</p>
<p>Five years ago, myself and a few of my best friends embarked on a journey to grow the entrepreneurial community in Lexington.</p>

<p>To say that we knew what we were doing, where we were going, or even had an ounce of understanding of what was to commence is a flat out lie.  It was more like trying to navigate through a dense fog when you can’t even see your hand two feet in front of you.  What we did have though, was a mission that we all believed in and the right combination of ambition, passion, willpower, and ignorance to think we could accomplish that mission.</p>
<p><span>The story of the Awesome Inc’s first five years leads to the two most important lessons I’ve learned as an entrepreneur - 1. Do something&hellip;seriously, anything.  Just do something because something is always better than nothing &amp; 2. Surround yourself with the right people in order to maximize success.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>The Something -</strong> </p>
<p>Since our mission was to grow the entrepreneurial community in Lexington, we started out by looking around the country at some truly awesome entrepreneurial communities.  We visited three in particular - San Francisco, Boulder, and Austin.  It’s worth noting that Boulder’s population is only about 100,000.  Lexington’s is about 300,000.  Austin’s population in 1995 was about 500,000.  The themes we noticed in these cities were simple:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>People worked on stuff they cared about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People started things quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entrepreneurs worked REALLY hard.  </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Some things we noticed that were NOT necessarily true:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>People in these cities were not any smarter than the people in Lexington.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The startup ideas that these entrepreneurs were working on weren’t any better than startup ideas we’ve heard in Lexington&hellip;in fact many of them were the same ideas.  </p>
</li>
</ul><p>Our biggest takeaway - do something fast.  So, we launched a Startup Weekend event and within a few months had 75 entrepreneurs hanging out to work on about 10 different companies for a weekend&hellip;awesome!  A few months later we rented out 6,500 square feet on main street and opened up a co-working space, mostly so we would look and feel “official”.  This enabled us to try experiment after experiment and discover the intersection of our abilities and the needs of entrepreneurs in Lexington.  </p>
<p>We had many failed experiments, like <a href="http://www.nextington.com/" target="_blank">Nextington</a> - a series of TED-like events OR giant touchscreen displaying interactive maps.</p>
<p>We had experiments that served their purpose but are no longer running anymore, like <a href="http://mobilexconference.com" target="_blank">mobileX</a>, a series of mobile technology conferences throughout the midwest that eventually transformed into our coding school, <a href="http://awesomeincu.com" target="_blank">Awesome Inc U</a>. </p>
<p>And we had experiments that succeeded and have persisted, like the co-working space, our internship program called <a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org/team-alpha/" target="_blank">Team Alpha</a>, the <a href="http://5across.org" target="_blank">5 Across pitch contest</a>, <a href="http://entrepreneurhof.com" target="_blank">The KY Entrepreneur Hall of Fame</a>, and our Accelerator/Incubator program (now: <a href="http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org" target="_blank">Awesome Fellowship</a>).</p>

<p>Through these experiments we were constantly learning, optimizing, and moving faster with every attempt.  Each one was designed to fill a void that we noticed in the entrepreneurial community and ultimately allow some subset of the population to pursue their definition of awesome.  We discovered that the main ingredient Lexington was missing was that people didn’t feel like they had permission to fail and subsequently wouldn’t try (to read more about how we feel about failing, check out <a href="http://blog.awesomeinc.org/post/65067426325/failing-in-order-to-succeed" target="_blank">this blog</a> or <a href="http://blog.awesomeinc.org/post/65146476414/how-to-get-people-to-fail-more" target="_blank">this one</a>).  This cultural difference was what separated cities like Boulder, SF, &amp; Austin from cities like Lexington.  </p>
<p>We even went as far as to create a Failure Dashboard and place it in a prominent location in our co-working space for people to post their failures.  </p>
<p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1280" data-orig-width="960" data-orig-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_uVTjnwu-_Cw3jt0FS19NrRXJ_WEYnFLIadN5gvGcd0TbBfZAjq7Q8cEWMmENi9SwPjwvpxsjBDgpNXiLE1lB9i5fM6Fc1_hv3vsj2crIGo1tO8URFYQzt6ocUdRbQ"><img alt="image" height="365px;" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/b34072b3317bf89785ef17ad52a777d5/tumblr_inline_pk1d4gWsQS1spm8pc_540.png" width="273px;" data-orig-height="1280" data-orig-width="960" data-orig-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_uVTjnwu-_Cw3jt0FS19NrRXJ_WEYnFLIadN5gvGcd0TbBfZAjq7Q8cEWMmENi9SwPjwvpxsjBDgpNXiLE1lB9i5fM6Fc1_hv3vsj2crIGo1tO8URFYQzt6ocUdRbQ"/></figure></p>
<p>We celebrated those failures as much as we celebrated the successes.  We learned that celebrating both failures and successes is important in order to get more people to “try” their definition of awesome.</p>
<p><span>We&rsquo;re constantly running new experiments and iterating on previous ones.  I&rsquo;m sure we have some of our biggest failures ahead of us, but I&rsquo;m also optimistic that we haven&rsquo;t scratched the surface of our biggest success.<br/><br/></span></p>
<p><strong>The People - </strong></p>
<p>When you’re doing something for the first time, you don’t really know what’s around the corner.  Therefore, the single most valuable thing you can do to prepare for the future in a startup is to surround yourself with the right people.  </p>
<p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="330" data-orig-width="924" data-orig-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FtPe2Pm-rdpb0LY6mrkD0F1MOTE9oJkNKj-M8oMvPXwHI7EHA6-BTGBSfm4FLjn8h4fHMVWSaBnvpoTBwNGUjsddLD-adiU2HYqlFrcd-lr-C-RhMDc5xCTM8GRorA"><img alt="image" height="323px;" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/04008caaf87a0d0235f91fa7d4654b31/tumblr_inline_pk1d4hmX7C1spm8pc_540.jpg" width="906px;" data-orig-height="330" data-orig-width="924" data-orig-src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FtPe2Pm-rdpb0LY6mrkD0F1MOTE9oJkNKj-M8oMvPXwHI7EHA6-BTGBSfm4FLjn8h4fHMVWSaBnvpoTBwNGUjsddLD-adiU2HYqlFrcd-lr-C-RhMDc5xCTM8GRorA"/></figure></p>
<p>At the end of this post, I’ve listed a few of the people that have made Awesome Inc truly awesome.  If you feel that Awesome Inc has helped you out in some way then pick a person (or two) from the list below and write them a thank you note ( I can get you their contact info if you need it).</p>

<p>The team at Awesome Inc has not only made the journey over the last 5 years more successful, but has also made it a more enjoyable experience.  If it wasn’t for the incredible team that I’ve been able to surround myself with, not only would we have failed much more often, I would have quit this venture a long time ago.</p>

<p>About 2 years into Awesome Inc I remember sitting in the conference room after facing a series of failures in a row and asking myself, “Why am I doing this? What’s the point in continuing?”.  I was on a low on the rollercoaster and considering throwing in the towel.  I remember the moment vividly when the distraught feeling of inevitable continuous failure turned to hope and excitement and I was reminded why I wasn’t going to quit.  I looked around the office and saw the members of my team working on their various initiatives.  I thought to myself, “With these guys on my team, we’re going to figure this out&hellip;we’re going to win.”</p>

<p>The mission of Awesome Inc is not near complete.  There are still people in our community that don’t get to pursue their definition of awesome.  But if the next 5 years provide us with the adventure, challenges, and pure joy that the last 5 have, I’ll be laughing, thinking and crying and truly living every step of the way.</p>
