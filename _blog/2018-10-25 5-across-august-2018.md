<p>As summer is coming to an end and school is back in session, Lexington entrepreneurs are showing no signs of slowing down. Noisemakers, delicious food, and the anticipated audience chatter could only mean one thing- another 5 Across was about to commence. The judges were ushered in with the help of an energetic audience and the pitches were ready to begin.<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="5184" data-orig-width="3456"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/65e60ff3f40bc95662b40dbf54e03296/tumblr_inline_ph6anyglgi1spm8pc_540.jpg" data-orig-height="5184" data-orig-width="3456"/></figure><p>		First up was <a href="http://www.eddiction.com/" target="_blank">Eddiction</a>, an online community forum that allows for alternative advertising and sets itself apart from traditional online marketing.

Through virtual 5Ks, individual campaigns, and easily identifiable gyms (“coined as Moolathon gyms”), users can interact with other fitness lovers while supporting their charity of choice. <br/>	The next pitchwas Lucille 1, a cryptocurrency and mining investment company. They guarantee to provide the hardware and know-how to potential cryptocurrency investors that are interested, but may not have access to the overhead required in beginning mining cryptocurrency.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3456" data-orig-width="5184"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/fa7dda6ae547916fdb5e2ff82832c0f4/tumblr_inline_ph6apaGqKg1spm8pc_540.jpg" data-orig-height="3456" data-orig-width="5184"/></figure><p>	The last pitch tackled a new way to consume sports-related news. <a href="https://insidecirclesports.com/" target="_blank">Inside Circle</a> is a fresh sports publication that creates and shared original content. By recruiting their audience through college internships, events, and merchandise, Inside Circle can effectively tackle the competition.

The vast variety of ideas pulsed through the room as the audience waited, antsy to hear the verdict.</p><p>	When the judges emerged, an audience drumroll filled the room and Inside Circle Sports was recognized as the <a href="https://www.5across.org/how-to-vote/" target="_blank">AwesomeVote</a> app winner. </p><p>	With a louder drumroll and cheering from the audience, Moolathon was announced the August 5 Across winner!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="3456" data-orig-width="5184"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/bda8995b5ecf81d4d7c44f9fce7bb5fb/tumblr_inline_ph6apxQbgI1spm8pc_540.jpg" data-orig-height="3456" data-orig-width="5184"/></figure><p>	Join us at the next 5 Across in October!
