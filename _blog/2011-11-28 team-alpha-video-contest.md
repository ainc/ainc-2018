<p>In order to replace a legend, Awesome Inc is looking for someone that follows rule #4 with a video camera .  For the past year, our <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/teamalpha" target="_blank">Team Alpha</a> member &lsquo;Focus&rsquo; has created some sick footage (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=1h3iG516RaM" target="_blank">here</a>,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=W9iSN6kBij4" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kLWAcZFsag&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">here</a>) of the most successful entrepreneurs in the state.  If we had it our way, he would have changed his mailing address to 348 E Main St. and we would have lived awesomely ever after, but alas, all good things must come to an end.  Hence, Awesome Inc is looking for a Team Alpha member to fill Focus&rsquo;s creative shoes.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that you can cast a creative vision and then execute on it in a compelling way. To see what you&rsquo;ve got, we&rsquo;ve created a contest for the <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/www.ballershirt.com" target="_blank">Basketball Jones T-Shirt website</a>.<span> </span>Your task is simple: create a one minute video that promotes the shirt in an 'awesome&rsquo; way&hellip;that is, of course, high tech and/or creative.<br/><br/>The top three finalists will be brought in for interviews and the winner will receive a semester-long position, doing videos of more of the highest-profile and most generally awesome people in the state&hellip;and all the donuts you can eat! <br/><br/>Submit your entry <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=en_US&amp;formkey=dHM5N1RSOXh1Si1XQkl5bjBGa2lodlE6MQ#gid=0" target="_blank">here</a>.
