And with the snap of your fingers, (actually \*snap\*, please,) we’re back!



It’s a brand new year, which means brand new companies who are gearing up to pitch and wow Kentucky with what they’re proud of creating. Most people understand what a pitch competition is and hope that we are recreating NBC’s Shark Tank but we aren’t doing exactly that.



5 Across is an atmosphere for entrepreneurs to pitch to a live audience about their venture while being welcomed with exuberant encouragement. Our goal is to make 5 Across a stepping stone in someone’s success journey.



These five companies are competing for February’s prize of $500 on February 26th, at Awesome Inc in Lexington, Kentucky. We want to help you get to know them so you can cheer them on along with us!
