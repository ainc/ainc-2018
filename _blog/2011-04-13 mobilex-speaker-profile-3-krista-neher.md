<p>Krista Neher is an author, educator, international speaker and consultant, and apparently very efficient at time management. She is the CEO of Boot Camp Digital, which trains companies to use social media for digital marketing. She wrote a bestselling book, Social Media Field Guide, and is the Managing Director of the Institute for Social Media at Cincinnati State. And in her spare time, she managed to teach her father to use text messaging.</p>
<p>Neher started off her career working at both Procter &amp; Gamble and an internet start-up company, Photrade. After transitioning to solely being the VP of Marketing at Photrade, she had to get creative about how to market with almost no budget. By using Twitter and corporate blogging, they were able to compete with the larger companies with bigger marketing budgets.</p>
<p>After the start up was acquired in 2008, Neher started teaching others how to use social media successfully, which was the start of her company Boot Camp Digital. She developed a social media program with Procter &amp; Gamble that is now being modeled across the country and has consulted for companies like ad:tech.</p>
<p>Neher will be attending the MobileX conference to speak on Mobile Marketing 101.</p>
