<p>Awesome Inc. put on a 6-day boot camp for current and aspiring entrepreneurs called AwesomeCamp. The participants worked hard every day from 8 am till 9 pm. Read on and get to know the AwesomeCamp companies and participants. Also, be sure to check out the AwesomeCamp music video at the bottom of this post!</p>
<p><strong>Amalgamations Studios:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Amalgamations Studios" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4102/4858296190_33fa17c6f7_z.jpg" width="300"/>Amalgamations Studios (<a href="http://amalgamationsstudios.com/" target="_blank">amalgamationsstudios.com</a>) is a web and software development company. Amalgamations Studios targeted customers are small, medium, and home businesses, across the globe. Amalgamations Studios will tackle any type of project the client wants done.</p>
<p>Amalgamations Studios came to AwesomeCamp in order to get started and get customers. The main goal they hope to achieve at AwesomeCamp is to become profitable.</p>
<p>Amalgamations Studios is a one man team consisting of Dave Boyer, who was sick of working for other people and after doing this for 2-3 years on his own, he&rsquo;s making it his business. His hardest challenge has been getting experience so he&rsquo;d have the opportunity to get experience, and AwesomeCamp has been helpful in making him set aside time he wouldn&rsquo;t normally set aside to work on Amalgamations Studios. Because Dave&rsquo;s business is just getting started, all the marathon sessions at AwesomeCamp have been especially productive</p>
<p><strong>Fresh:</strong></p>
<img alt="Fresh" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4123/4857657111_5041da84a4.jpg" width="300"/><p>Fresh (<a href="http://befresh.us/" target="_blank">befresh.us</a>) is a door to door laundry service in Lexington with a 24 hour turnaround. Their core value is to provide &ldquo;fresh, flawless laundry done fast by friends having fun.&rdquo; Customers sign up on the website and pick a schedule to have their laundry done every 1 or 2 weeks. Fresh washes, dries, and folds the laundry before dropping it back off. Fresh is perfect for college students and young professionals and they hope to eventually contract with restaurants and hotels.</p>
<p>Fresh is at AwesomeCamp to design their internal infrastructure and marketing plan. UK starts in 2 weeks and they want to be ready to go, and AwesomeCamp has made them set hard deadlines to get work done. The Fresh team has done trials run with family and friends&rsquo; laundry, met with local laundromat owners, and at AwesomeCamp they&rsquo;ve been creating their brand by making videos and handout cards with their core values.</p>
<p>Fresh started as an idea for a fast food delivery service between classmates Garrett Ebel and Aaron Fons. After teaming up with Awesome Inc.&rsquo;s Luke Murray the idea evolved into a laundry service. Then Matt &ldquo;Cool&rdquo; Storrs and Lauren Fleming joined too, finishing off the Fresh team. All of them have been hard at work at AwesomeCamp.</p>
<p><strong>ModelSensation:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="ModelSensation" height="300" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4139/4867683474_741a38e1eb.jpg" width="300"/>ModelSensation (<a href="http://modelsensation.com/" target="_blank">modelsensation.com</a>) is a model photography and promotion company. They help companies advertise products or services, and provide advertising companies with talent for events like commercials or special occasions. ModelSensation hopes to have their brand evolve to licensing contracts to apparel and merchandise and have TV and media products to feature the models.</p>
<p>ModelSensation was founded to provide opportunities for talented people in the Lexington area. ModelSensation&rsquo;s greatest reward has been witnessing models being able to realize their dreams.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that people pay attention to beautiful models, ModelSensation wants to direct this attention to important issues like fighting racism by having many nationalities of models. ModelSensation is about seeing models as humans and not just a means to sell a product.</p>
<p>For AwesomeCamp participant Zabu Mutua, photography was just a hobby until he realized that it takes just one person with a dream to become successful. Although ModelSensation has been around for 3 years, Zabu came to AwesomeCamp because the complexity of even the most modest project requires organization and structure. Image is everything in the modeling world, and ModelSensation strives to always be professional and not miss opportunities due to a lack of foresight. At AwesomeCamp, Zabu has been able to accomplish a lot in short period of time.</p>

<p><img alt="OMG!itsuhcamel:D" height="300" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4139/4858287376_5fdd30edb5.jpg" width="300"/>OMG!itsuhcamel:D (<a href="http://youtube.com/user/OMGitsuhcamelpro" target="_blank">youtube.com/user/OMGitsuhcamelpro</a>) is a video production company where they do &ldquo;everything but act&rdquo;. From filming, editing, to even writing scripts, for anyone needing a promotional video, they do it all. They also launch their own videos, aimed at the younger crowd, on their YouTube page.</p>
<p>Drew Trommer attended a NY film academy and took a year long course on video production at Bryan Station High School. He met Alexie Basil through a mutual friend and ended up helping her with a school project. It turned out so well they decided to keep working together creatively. Their biggest obstacle is their creative differences, which is where AwesomeCamp comes in.</p>
<p>Drew and Alexie came to AwesomeCamp to get more experience and publicity, but the greatest benefit has been working together so much and working towards a common artist product when they have differing visions. Throughout AwesomeCamp, they have been working with 12 year old Charlotte Arnold on her YouTube show It&rsquo;s The Charlotte Show (youtube.com/user/itsthecharlotteshow).</p>
<p><strong>PI Modeling:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="PI Modeling" height="300" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4102/4867068193_4db0380aec.jpg" width="300"/>Pope International Model Management (PIMrising.wordpress.com) focuses on innovations in modeling and fashion and development of talent. They are filling the void in model management in Lexington &ldquo;with the belief that the best company for models is the one run by models.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rory Pope has been a model for 11+ years so he can help his clients navigate the sometimes exploitative modeling market. Trying to break the stereotype that models are just a product and not people, he wants to be an advocate for talents and get their careers on a positive path so they won&rsquo;t be turned off by bad experiences.</p>
<p>PI Modeling is partnered with ModelSensation, Pandora Photography, and Jordan Yoder photography. PI Modeling&rsquo;s upcoming project, to be premiered at Awesome Inc., is the &ldquo;Body Is Beautiful&rdquo; campaign. This focuses on promoting female beauty no matter size or age in hopes to empower women.</p>
<p>PI Modeling came to AwesomeCamp to find focus and benefit from the mentorship available. Their goals are to define core values, create a hotdog stand, and gain capital. Rory likes the structure and formality of AwesomeCamp. Everyone is there to work and be productive.</p>
<p><strong>Remix Education:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Remix Education" height="300" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4095/4857668111_7d1fc24143.jpg" width="300"/>Remix Education (<a href="http://remixeducation.com/" target="_blank">remixeducation.com</a>) provides motivational assemblies at schools and churches using interactive mascot performances. Each assembly is tailored to the particular group, but some topics are antidrug, anti bullying, and the Gospel. The programs are a fun, entertaining way to educate kids about living better and healthier.</p>
<p>Remix Education programs are for kids of any grade. While available at any place they are wanted or needed, they currently work mainly in Kentucky. The hope in the near future is to expand to other states and eventually go on mission trips to other countries. Remix Education wants to have the opportunities to impact more people and spread the Gospel.</p>
<p>In order to reach these goals, and overcome their biggest challenge of being unorganized, Remix Education came to AwesomeCamp. Their aim is to get a better system in place to run their business like a business, have an expansion plan, and be able to franchise. The most helpful part of AwesomeCamp has been the marathon session where they got High Rise CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software; they now have a new program to keep track of clients.</p>
<p>The members of Remix Education at AwesomeCamp are Matt and Jenny Hogg and Butch Vernon. They were inspired by the Gospel, their love of kids, and entertaining, and wanted to use their talents to help kids. Matt has a background as a mascot for many different teams, and Jenny is a cheerleader, skills they use to pump students up. They have enjoyed the unique features of AwesomeCamp such as starting at the YMCA in the morning to get energized, and being able to meet and interact with other AwesomeCamp participates.</p>
<p><strong>Rockstar Association:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Rockstar Assocation" height="300" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4115/4858301220_31ab0d2a13.jpg" width="300"/>Rockstar Association (<a href="http://rockstarassociation.com/" target="_blank">rockstarassociation.com</a>) is all about human interaction in the music industry because there is no separation between music and life. Rockstar Association wants to foster a creative atmosphere where they can build strong alliances to the music industry and help make connections among them. With the goal of bringing together musicians in the Lexington area to form relationships based on a mutual love of music, Rockstar Association is well served by musician and AwesomeCamp participant Nathan LeClaire.</p>
<p>Not only able to sing and play guitar, bass, drums, and keys, Nathan also has a technical background to help with the business side of things. Most important to him though is the ability to relate to people. Nathan convinced Awesome Inc. neighbor Farzin to let Rockstar Association have jam sessions in his space. Just a few months old, Rockstar Association has held a few jam sessions already but hopes to host regular sessions in the future. With the belief that people should help each other out, Nathan created the theme song for another AwesomeCamp participant&rsquo;s show. This human connection is what makes Rockstar Association more than just about finding rehearsal spaces, but about getting to know and help musicians personally.</p>
<p>The Rockstar Association office at Awesome Inc. is in a loft accessed solely by a rock wall. This fun, relaxed environment coupled with Brian and Luke&rsquo;s charms brought Rockstar Association to AwesomeCamp to &ldquo;meet awesome people, learn awesome things, and play awesome music.&rdquo; The best part of AwesomeCamp is the structure of work versus play. The day starts out at the YMCA, where they hang out and read before working out. Then it&rsquo;s time to be focused and work, and the marathon sessions make it easy to keep on task. As Nathan says, &ldquo;AwesomeCamp is awesome!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The Beer Guy:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="The Beer Guy" height="300" src="http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4121/4867684144_75f0ff8a66.jpg" width="300"/>Unofficially known as &ldquo;The Beer Guy&rdquo;, Evan Blanford is a quality beer enthusiastic. He loves talking about beer- the way it&rsquo;s made, what glass should be used, and especially its story. Evan is working on a website with videos, blog posts, and interviews with beer enthusiasts and people in the industry, such as home brewers. He hopes to do half as much in the beer industry as his inspiration, Gary Vaynerchuk, has done in the wine industry.</p>
<p>Hardly a drinker, Evan prefers to have just one well made beer. He first discovered that beer could taste good while visiting Belgium. He was enlightened on how much he didn&rsquo;t know and has been striving to learn more about beer ever since.</p>
<p>Evan came to AwesomeCamp because it is filled with inspirational and motivational people in a relaxed environment. He thought it sounded easy to start his company, but he never found the time before AwesomeCamp. With the constructive pressure at AwesomeCamp, Evan feels nothing is out of reach.</p>
<p><strong>Uvestor:</strong></p>
<p>Uvestor (<a href="http://uvestor.com/" target="_blank">uvestor.com</a>) provides real estate software with business management tools to make the real estate industry less complicated and more transparent. Ideal for investors and brokers, Uvestor software helps with document management, expense tracking, and team communication.</p>
<p>Uvestor&rsquo;s biggest obstacle is achieving product/market fit in a large industry. They hope to soon grow into the industry standard. With background in buying and selling short sales, they want to make the real estate industry less confusing.</p>
<p>Participants Chris Combs and John Williamson did not view AwesomeCamp as a boot camp, but as an &ldquo;entrepreneur day spa&rdquo;. The spirit of entrepreneurships at Awesome Inc. revitalized their thinking and brought in new ideas. They have a special connection to Awesome Inc. because Luke Murray played matchmaker and brought them together as business partners.</p>
