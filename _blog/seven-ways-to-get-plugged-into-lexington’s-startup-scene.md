description: Get involved in the startup community!
---
Known internationally for horses, bourbon, and basketball, Central KY is now making its mark in a different world - startups and technology.

In 2019, Lexington was rated [one of the top 10 cities in the US for entrepreneurs](https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/make-money/start-a-business/best-cities-for-entrepreneurs/) and in this year alone, Kentucky companies accelerated through Awesome Inc's Fellowship Program have raised $12m. As we mentioned, things are happening. So much so that [KY Innovation](https://www.kyinnovation.com/), the state’s entrepreneurship and innovation enterprise, has invested more than $1M into the Lexington community to encourage growth. 

So, why do you care and what does that mean to you?

Well, are you an entrepreneur, investor, developer, or a curious and passionate person who cares about things that matter?

Then you should get involved. And we’re here to help (you can thank us later)!

6. Make an Introduction

The Lexington community operates out of a “Give First” mentality. That means that we always try to give before we ask. So - want to get connected to more of the right people? Start by introducing two people you know who share a similar passion or skill who should know each other! Show others that you’re willing to make connections and support the growth of our community.



7. Ask To Grab Coffee

Be bold. Find someone who you want to learn from or collaborate with via [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/startuplexington/shared_invite/enQtNjA2MDk2MjQ0ODM5LTI2Y2YxNmM0MjE1YjQ5ZWQ1NjI4MDRjZmI2ODM3Nzc0YmU1NDI2ZmZlNjQ0MTE1ZTQ0NTIwMzZkZWFkYjU5ODA) or send out an email asking for time. Pro tips - come with prepared questions and never, ever forget to write a thank-you note afterward.

We love Kentucky, and not just because of our superior basketball team (Do not @ us). We’re proud to be a part of a collaborative community that’s dedicated to creating a community where people pursue their definition of Awesome in the tech and startup space.

See you around!
