<p>Growing up I slept on the top level of a red metallic bunk bed in a room shared with my younger brother.  Our matching bed sheets were decorated with a little bears dressed as astronauts and text that read, “One small step for a bear, one giant leap for bearkind.”   Each night, I would climb up the ladder and each morning I would heave myself over the side to land on my brother’s mattress.  </p>
<p>Having such a cool bed is something that I took for granted.  Each night I knew that I had a comfortable and safe place to get a good night’s rest.  However, not all families can afford the high upfront cost of furnishing a bed frame, box spring, mattress, sheets, pillows, and blankets for all of their children.  Unfortunately, these children never get to experience the sense of security that comes with having a bed to call their own.  </p>
<p>When members of the <a href="http://continuousjoy.org" target="_blank">Joy Project </a>learned that several local Lexington children were without beds, they decided to host a Build A Bed event to make a difference.  In order to maximize the impact of this event, they recruited over 30 volunteers to donate their Saturday building brand new beds and delivering them to children in need around Lexington.  </p>

<p>The event kicked off around 10am in typical Awesome Inc fashion complete with Chicago Bulls style introductions for each volunteer.  The volunteers then split up into five teams and got to work.  After three hours of construction and staining, the teams had built six twin sized beds to be delivered.  The rest of the afternoon was spent cruising the streets of Lexington and dropping off the new beds, mattresses, and bedding for six incredibly grateful and deserving boys and girls.  One of the highlights of the day was seeing a young girl jump up on her brand new bed and enthusiastically shout, “This is just fantastic!”</p>

<p><br/><span>Thank you to all of the hard working volunteers who gave their time and energy to make Lexington a better place by selfishly creating joy for others.  A special thanks to </span><a href="http://suffsfurniture.com/" target="_blank">Suff’s Fine Furniture</a> for their generous donation of six mattresses!  You all are awesome!</p>
