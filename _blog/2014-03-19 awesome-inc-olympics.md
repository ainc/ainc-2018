<p><span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>As the Winter Olympics in Sochi drew to a close last month, Awesome Inc’s Olympic Committee was just convening. The latter edition included Jamaica (coldest month: January with average lows of 76°), Falkland Islands (a mere penguin’s swim away from Antarctica), Mexico (whose lone medalist in Winter Olympic history is an Austrian prince), and Iceland (home to zero McDonald’s restaurants). Each team fought valiantly in a mixed bag of events featuring skeleton on a challenging hardwood surface, a controversial broomball tournament, a hybrid triple jump/ring toss event, ga-ga, and four-way dodge ball. <figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="720" data-orig-width="960" data-orig-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VmSjWkapQXCtXzTM_UvUKJ9xriIWFKhWDt_2qNStbiG6x9uukdQTkm0l0r7StOIos6bEfh2QhBGe-Qf62v3hYN6kk7lq_Lj5_sBAId9H9-Lwn6eucrqXHWLaV70dfw"><img alt="1656001_10101830507300620_1306334572_n.jpg" height="180px;" src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/502b58a29361dc25ab5296a6781a3d46/tumblr_inline_pk3dyxRd8c1spm8pc_540.jpg" width="240px;" data-orig-height="720" data-orig-width="960" data-orig-src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/VmSjWkapQXCtXzTM_UvUKJ9xriIWFKhWDt_2qNStbiG6x9uukdQTkm0l0r7StOIos6bEfh2QhBGe-Qf62v3hYN6kk7lq_Lj5_sBAId9H9-Lwn6eucrqXHWLaV70dfw"/></figure></p>
<p> <span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>After an ostentatious opening ceremony that included a burning torch, the games were christened. This year was not without drama either: the Mexican delegation to the games (headed by our very own Garrett Ebel) accused the dramatically successful Iceland (captained by Theresa Simcic) team of continually cheating. These allegations included using a non-IFBA approved stick for broomball*. However after further inquiries, the rulebook had no specific standing either way on using a household Swiffer. Further scrutiny was attached to the Iceland squad when Tommy Crush, a local legend in the interpretive dance world, had to perform the higher honor of judging the competition. Despite his national ties, Falkland Islands dazzled the crowd with a passionate and inspired performance and rightly took home the gold. Jamaica’s local take on Mulan’s “I’ll Make a Man Out of You,” was a real crowd pleaser featuring action, romance, the burdens of war, and props. The athletes’ favorite was a dodge ball competition including all nations. All four teams were placed in a quadrant with balls lined up across the middle. The entire game consisted of four matches and teams employed varying tactics. Falkland Islands retreated into their corner in a phalanx formation being opportunistic with their chances. Iceland, perhaps too eager from their medal count, failed to develop any strategy until the final round. Andrew Shields, who spent a larger part of his youth training with the late Patches O’Houlihan, anchored Mexico. Shields was frequently the last remaining member of his team. Despite each nation’s late bid to boost their respective medal count, a favorable training environment, superior leadership, and unrivaled cohesion allowed Iceland to capture the overall competition. The true spirit of the Olympics was again on display during the closing ceremonies and everyone was reminded of rule #17: Bring the fun.</p>

<p><br/><span></span>*IFBA (International Federation of Broomball Associations, the governing body) has since ruled Swiffer is not a permissible substitute for a broom, it will not be allowed from any IFBA-sanctioned event henceforth. The notorious “Swiffer incident of ‘14” forced IFBA officials to hand to down a quick and decisive ruling.</p>
