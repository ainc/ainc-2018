<p>Are you looking for an internship? Does being paid in doughnuts sound awesome to you? Do you want to join the coolest team in town? Apply to be a part of Team Alpha today!</p>
<p>Who We Are</p>
<p>Team Alpha is Awesome Inc&rsquo;s group of interns, but don&rsquo;t let them hear you call them that. Besides working at the most exciting place in town, Team Alpha members have the opportunities, resources, and mentorships to pursue their own projects. For example, Tyler Green, aka Green T, not only does web development for Awesome Inc websites, he created his own, <a href="http://stadiumfanatic.com/" target="_blank">Stadium Fanatic</a>.</p>
<p>Why We&rsquo;re Awesome</p>
<p>Team Alpha currently has around twenty members, each one more awesome than the next. Team Alpha&rsquo;s captain, Therese, is way more fun than any other boss you&rsquo;ll have, as you can tell from her <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/team-alpha/?id=1" target="_blank">video</a>. Charlotte, Team Alpha&rsquo;s youngest member, can be seen riding her unicycle throughout the space. Thomas gets to hang out with millionaires, like the Dippin&rsquo; Dots inventor, for his job as videographer for the Founders Series.</p>
<p>To find out more about all of the Team Alpha members, you can view their profiles <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/team-alpha/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>What We Need</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re looking for anyone who wants to have fun and follow Rule # 4, do something awesome over something not awesome. Our primary need is for people interested in social media, video, web development, and graphic design. We also need event coordinators, marketing and PR people, and writers.</p>
<p>Why You Should Join</p>
<p>While you won&rsquo;t get paid with cash money, you will get free doughnuts, a free T-shirt, and awesome opportunities you won&rsquo;t get at other jobs. Also, if you&rsquo;re cool enough, you too can get a sweet nickname like Party, Cool, Thunder, and Green T did. Be sure to watch the music video to see how much fun you will have on Team Alpha.</p>
