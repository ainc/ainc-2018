<p>Like many cities, Lexington’s technology community is experiencing a shortage of well-qualified software developers. Many cities have benefitted from training programs called Developer Bootcamps. The general model is a 3-month program, in batches of 10-20 students, with a curriculum for full-stack web development jobs. Successful programs are highly selective of their applicants. The Bootcamp is taught by experienced developers with industry experience, with a focus on quickly moving from basic skills to hands-on projects. High job placement rates (close to 100%) are the target for these programs.</p><p><br/>Companies and organizations in the Lexington area are hungry for employees with Information Technology talent. One of the greatest needs is for people who can build web applications using open-source technologies. This includes skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Angular.js, Python / Django, Ruby on Rails, PHP, Node.js, Git, AWS, and more. <br/></p><p>Click this <a href="http://www.lanereport.com/63017/2016/04/awesome-inc-to-launch-web-developer-program-in-lexington/" target="_blank">link</a> for Lane Report’s press release on Awesome Inc U.</p>
