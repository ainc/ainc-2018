<p>For those of you who haven&rsquo;t heard of 5 Across, heres the scoop. 5 Across is an informal gathering of entrepreneurs, investors and service providers from Lexington, KY. Each 5 Across meeting features presentations from local entrepreneurs who pitch their ideas to a panel of judges. There are 5 pitches, 5 slides per pitch, 5 minutes per pitch, a 5pm start time, and normally, a $500 prize to the winning pitch. The panel of judges decides the final winner but the audience will be able to participate by submitting their votes through their mobile device. But this final upcoming event will be different. It will consist of the past 5 winners competing for the grand prize of $2,500.</p>
