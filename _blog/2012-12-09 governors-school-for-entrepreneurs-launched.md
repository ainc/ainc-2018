<p><strong>Governor&rsquo;s School for Entrepreneurs Launched</strong></p>
<p>A new initiative designed to enhance creative thinking and entrepreneurial skills among high school students in Kentucky was announced Wednesday, December 5th at a press conference hosted by Governor Steve Beshear. The Governor&rsquo;s School for Entrepreneurs (GSE), building on the successful Governor&rsquo;s Scholars and Governor&rsquo;s School For the Arts programs, will bring together high school students, teachers, colleges, universities, entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers and product designers in an annual immersive high-energy summer experience. This summer program will be followed with additional educational experiences. The June 2013 site for the summer GSE program will be Georgetown College.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that most of the net new jobs across the U.S. are being created by small, young companies,&rdquo; said Gov. Beshear. &ldquo;This new initiative is part of a larger, ambitious strategy to create a dynamic entrepreneurial economy in Kentucky. Building a successful 21st century economy must begin by preparing our young people to be familiar with creative thinking and design thinking. We need them to fully understand the process of creating an innovative product or service and developing a business model around it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young people are shaping the ideas and innovations forming the economic future of our state and nation. By developing talent early and broadly Kentucky can remain competitive in emerging economies driven by innovation and entrepreneurial skills. GSE seeks to uncover young talent that traditional academic pathways might not draw out. Participating students will be from multiple backgrounds with diverse talents and ideas and a passion to create something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;GSE stands out from many other youth entrepreneurship programs because it places a strong emphasis on business fundamentals, entrepreneurship and product design as well as creative thinking and the innovation process,&rdquo; said Laurie Daugherty, Director of GSE and Associate Vice President of the Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation.</p>
<p>GSE will be working in partnership with a range of companies and organizations, including the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development, Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education and The Kentucky Innovation Network in the design and execution of the program. The program will be led by the Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation.</p>
<p>GSE will begin accepting applications as of today, December 6, 2012 through February 15, 2013. Information and details can be found at gse.kstc.com.</p>
