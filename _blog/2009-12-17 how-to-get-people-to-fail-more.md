<p>Winners are the ones who fail. Failures are the ones who never play. First, the best podcasts on entrepreneurship are the ones found at Stanford&rsquo;s Entrepreneur Corner, or e-corner (<a href="http://ecorner.stanford.edu/podcasts.html" target="_blank">http://ecorner.stanford.edu/podcasts.html</a>). Speakers for Stanford&rsquo;s Entrepreneur Seminar Series include such high profile people as Carly Fiorina (former HP CEO), Steve Balmer (Microsoft CEO), and Mark Zuckerberg (facebook founder &amp; CEO). However, one of the best talks I&rsquo;ve heard in this series (and I&rsquo;ve listened to at least half of the 100+ lectures) is by the director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program - Tina Seelig. She teaches entrepreneurship at Stanford and gave a talk on how to do this well.</p>
<p>The part from the lecture that stuck out to me the most was how much she encouraged failure. The ratio of your successes to failures is probably going to stay the same, so the path to more successes is more failures. The same is true in so many other things in life - the salesman with the most sales has probably been told &lsquo;no&rsquo; the most, the baseball player with the most hits probably has the most strikeouts, the musician with the most hit singles probably has more &ldquo;dud&rdquo; songs than other musicians&hellip;and the person with the most successful company has probably had more failed companies and more failures within their current company than the person with the mediocre company.</p>
<p>So, if failure is so important to success, then why don&rsquo;t people do it? The same reason they don&rsquo;t go skydiving or ride rollercoasters&hellip;the perception of danger. 99.99% of the time, going skydiving or riding in a rollercoaster will not kill you or even hurt you. But people see what could happen and this keeps them from doing it. To a much lesser degree, people don&rsquo;t embrace failure in life because of the perceived pain as well. Getting shot down by a girl at a bar doesn&rsquo;t actually physically harm you or put you in danger in any way. Neither does being rejected when selling a product, or putting together an event that nobody shows up to. It&rsquo;s just not worth the perceived danger or the damage to our egos or feelings.</p>
<p>How do you fight this? How do you create a culture that embraces and celebrates failures? We don&rsquo;t know yet, but here at Awesome Inc. we must figure it out if we want to build a culture full of winners. This is what we&rsquo;ve done so far:</p>
<p>- Go Big Friday - fail big every Friday. The risk must have a massive potential upside for you and a very high likelihood of failure. It must be at least somewhat relevant to your personal goals (i.e. contact the president of the most successful company in town and ask to meet with them). Twitter hashtag: #gobigfriday.

<p>- The Failure Dashboard - a large whiteboard in the middle of our break room where you record your failure &amp; the lesson you learned from it. Awards will be given monthly for the largest failure and the highest number of failures each month. What ideas do you have that would help create a culture that encourages trying new things and embraces failure as a tool to reach success?</p>
