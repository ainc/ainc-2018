<p><img alt="tony ho" height="201" src="http://awesomeinc.org/images/showcase/150x201xtony_ho.jpg.pagespeed.ic.o8NKzq2QHJ.jpg" width="150"/>Tony found Awesome Inc in 2010. He was a recent graduate of the University of Kentucky in Chemical Engineering and was looking for an internship that would get him some experience in web design. He thought startups were cool and wanted to run his own someday. So he applied for Team Alpha, the internship program at Awesome Inc.</p>

<p>When Tony joined our web design team, not only did he get to learn about web programming and be in the presence of other great web designers&hellip;he got to <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/awesomeinc-caving-trip" target="_blank">go on an epic caving trip</a>, earned a tshirt and some dog tags, and got to hang out with some of the top entrepreneurs in the country (<a href="http://www.inc.com/video/201107/live-chat-brian-wong-kiip.html" target="_blank">Brian Wong</a>, <a href="http://betabeat.com/2012/06/localresponse-growth-profitability/" target="_blank">Nihal Mehta</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Schnatter" target="_blank">John Schnatter</a>).</p>
<p>Oh, and not to mention, the stuff Tony worked on actually mattered. See some of Tony&rsquo;s work from his internship here:</p>
<p><a href="http://mobilexconference.com/" target="_blank">MobileX</a>, <a href="http://www.entrepreneurhof.com/" target="_blank">Entrepreneur Hall of Fame</a>, and <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc</a> sites.</p>
<p>Now Tony is living the dream in sunny San Francisco, the entrepreneurial capital of the world, working for a fully funded startup called <a href="http://www.getable.com/" target="_blank">getable</a>.</p>
