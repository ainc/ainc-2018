<p>5 o&rsquo; clock, 5 pitches, 500 dollars: 5 Across. Halloween&rsquo;s meeting saw more excellent pitches for innovative ideas and businesses. This meeting also saw Brad Feld, seasoned entrepreneur, startup community thought leader, and angel investor, amongst the panel of judges. About 50 people attended the event.</p>
<p><strong>Will Blackford</strong> pitched <strong>Pegasus</strong>, an on-demand, on-campus ridesharing mobile application designed to cut down on a myriad of issues that arise on college campuses from unreliable taxi companies to driving under the influence.</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Moore</strong> pitched <strong>Chelsea&rsquo;s List</strong>, a database of local equine businesses and individuals providing services within the industry available for the public to search.</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Quinlan</strong> pitched her <strong>idea for a social network</strong> to bring athletes, coaches, and those in the sports industry together, as well as provide exposure for all the above parties. It is conceptually similar to LinkedIn, but it offers specialized features that LinkedIn doesn&rsquo;t offer that are particularly pertinent to the sports environment.</p>
<p><strong>Anne Nash</strong> and <strong>Bebe Brechner</strong> pitched <strong><a href="http://www.enskri.com/" target="_blank">Enskri</a></strong>, an e-gifting personalization and enhancement service. Enskri adds on pricing for personalization options at point of purchase of virtual gifts including e-books, games, music, movies, and more!</p>
<p><strong>Dan Adams</strong> pitched <strong><a href="http://www.earthineer.com/" target="_blank">Earthineer</a></strong>, a network designed exclusively for homesteading and sustainable living which allows people to socialize, find experts, and trade.</p>
<p>Stephanie Quinlan and her idea for a social network for the athletic industry was chosen as the favorite by the audience via text vote. <strong><a href="http://www.earthineer.com/" target="_blank">Earthineer</a></strong> was chosen by the judges as the winner of the grand prize. Overall, this meeting was a resounding success!</p>
<p>Congratulations to all of the teams who participated. Awesome Inc wishes them the best of luck in their entrepreneurial pursuits! Stay tuned for more information on the final meeting of 5 Across for the 2012 season on December 5th!</p>
