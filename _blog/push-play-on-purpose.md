**Take a glimpse into a recent conversation on our podcast with [Steve Seidel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephenseidel/) of The Seidel Agency. As a virtual CMO, Steve helps businesses grow to six figures and above by using organic content. Check out [his website](https://theseidelagency.com/free-consultation/) and don't forget to listen to the rest of his podcast episode [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/push-play-on-purpose/id1453583729?i=1000562098242).** 



**Garrett:** Talk about your virtual CMO and where that came from.

**Steve:** I try to make things as simple as possible. It's important as a person, a business owner, and an entrepreneur to understand your strengths and your weaknesses. One of my weaknesses is that I became a people pleaser, so I was constantly trying to do things for other people. But it's not about pleasing other people; it's about having a solid purpose and understanding your why. That's how I built my business. Keep it simple; because I often, as a people pleaser, will overshare and send super long emails and people get overwhelmed.



At the end of the day, people usually just care about themselves or what they’re working on. So, as a business owner, put your value first and how can you help other people. Do good, give back, and make an impact. That’s what I'm all about.



One of the things that I've transitioned to is going from good to great; it’s important to understand that everybody has greatness within them. Actualizing that and believing in yourself is key.



So what I do as a company is I help small business owners. I have a couple of niches. They say the riches are in the niches. So I work in aesthetic medicine. I help dermatologists, med spa owners, plastic surgeons, and cosmetic dentists grow their businesses by putting together a solid organic content foundation.



We want to give them content that tells their story. And so I came up with a unique slogan: “From looking to booking.” Instead of people looking at their content, we really want them to book or to buy into you. We want them to vote with their dollar.

I help small businesses grow to six figures and above by using this organic content. And I have the side of social media where it's basically a social referral engine because Word of Mouth Marketing is the most powerful form of Marketing.



And we find ways to leverage that. With our coaching, we go from good to **GREAT**. 



**GREAT** stands for:

**G**rateful - We’re all blessed. You don’t have to go to work, you get to go to work.

**R**eflective - Look for learning lessons and teaching moments.

**E**thical - Make sure your actions are having a positive impact on the people around you.

**A**ccountability - We all need to be accountable for our actions.

**T**ransformational - How are we making the world a better place?



And so identify those whys in your life. You know, why do I get up every morning to provide for my family? To leave this world a better place and to find happiness. That was a really long-winded answer, but hopefully it was beneficial.
