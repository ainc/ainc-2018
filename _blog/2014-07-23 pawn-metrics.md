<p>The Awesome Inc Fellowship is a competitive program for early stage startups, designed to accelerate their growth. The program caters to the individual needs of the startups it accepts and provides a timeline that is unique to each business. The Fellowship’s most recently accepted team is Pawn Metrics. They have created a web based app for taking inventory at pawn shops.</p>

<p><br/><span>The idea for Pawn Metrics came from founder Jacob Valenta’s experience working at a pawn shop. After witnessing the disorganization of the shop, Valenta created a web based app to help the shop do inventory. With the help of partners Ioan Ozarchevici and Jay Hamilton, Valenta’s program became Pawn Metrics, a complex system that allows pawn shops to efficiently take inventory in a way that’s easier than ever before. The website features new pricing methods similar to eBay, in an attempt to price items as accurately as possible, and a tagging system that greatly increases the speed of taking inventory. Pawn Metrics was introduced to the Awesome Fellowship Program through a recommendation from Ozarchevici’s boss, Scott Johnson, who is involved with several of Awesome Inc’s initiatives. Since being accepted into the competitive program, the Awesome Fellowship Program has helped resolve a few technical issues, as well as providing a ‘checklist’ to finalize the site and get it ready to market to potential clients. By emphasizing Lean Startup methodologies such as the importance of a minimum viable product and customer driven product development, Pawn Metrics is in the process of getting their site out to customers as quickly as possible. Valenta, Ozarchevici, and Hamilton are hoping to make their first sale to a pawn shop chain within the next two months.</span></p>
