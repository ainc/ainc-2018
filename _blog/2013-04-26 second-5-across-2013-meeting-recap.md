<p><a href="http://5across.org/" target="_blank">5 Across</a> returned to Lexington on Wednesday for the second meeting of 2013. Five competitive teams pitched their company ideas to a panel of judges as well as a full crowd who traveled from as far away as the greater Louisville and Cincinnati areas to be in attendance.</p>
<p>Teams included:</p>
<p>Arial Boulware pitched her idea for a <strong>24/7 workspace for students</strong> to study, print, nap, and more. The business has no official title yet, but a working title is Growing Ambitions</p>
<p>LaShana M. Harris pitched<strong> <a href="http://babylocity.com/" target="_blank">Babylocity</a></strong>, a new baby bottle designed to make it easier for parents to mix powdered baby formula on-the-go.</p>
<p>Brock Klein pitched <strong><a href="https://www.givrmobile.com/" target="_blank">Givr</a></strong>, a native donor-facing mobile payments application optimized for giving.</p>
<p>Jeff Garrison, Darrin Croucher, and Andrew Wright pitched <strong><a href="http://ireport360.com/" target="_blank">iReport360</a></strong>, an internet, cloud-based communication system for the construction industry.</p>
<p>Cyrus Adkisson pitched<strong> hoozon.tv</strong>, which watches a local TV station, uses biometric facial recognition to look for reporters&rsquo; faces, then drives traffic to the station by automatically sharing the live stream via media personalities&rsquo; social media posts.</p>
<p><strong>Babylocity</strong> took home the $500 prize for their innovative baby bottle. They will be given the opportunity to pitch at the 5 Across Finals in December as well the Lexington Venture Club in May. <strong>Babylocity</strong> also won the audience text vote.</p>
<p>The night&rsquo;s excellent pitches and heavy turnout resulted in another great event for Lexington&rsquo;s startup community. Congratulations to all of the teams who participated and we offer a special thanks to our sponsors and friends who help make 5 Across happen! Be sure not to miss 2013&rsquo;s third meeting of 5 Across Wednesday June 26th where five teams will once again compete for the $500 prize.</p>
