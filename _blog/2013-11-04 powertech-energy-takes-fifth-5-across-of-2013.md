<p>Our final regular edition 5 Across of 2013 has come to a close. On Wednesday, October 30th, PowerTech Energy took the prize for their product, a water treatment device that desalinates and purifies water. What makes this device unique is it does not remove water from salt and impurities like other processes with a membrane, but pulls salt and impurities from the water directly. This process is more energy efficient and can process water more quickly. PowerTech Energy was founded by Dr. James Landon, Dr. Kunlei Liu, and Dr. Cameron Lippert. The text vote winner for the event was <a href="http://scante.net" target="_blank">Scante</a>, founded by Jon Prescott and Tom Dichiaro. Scante provides mobile customer experience apps that allows companies that use the “internet of things” data to drive after sales revenue and provide better customer service.
