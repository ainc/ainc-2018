<p>Awesome Inc helped kick off the Entrepreneur Leadership Institute (ELI) program by hosting the students for lunch and talking to them about what it takes to be an entrepreneur. Awesome Inc staff member and co-founder of <a href="http://befresh.us/" title="Fresh Laundry" target="_blank">Fresh Laundry</a>, Aaron Fons, talked to the teams about what it takes to win at business.</p>

<p>He referenced experiences of his own while starting Fresh Laundry such as how much discipline it took to work 40+ hours per week on his startup, not making any money for the first several months. Founder of Awesome Inc, Brian Raney, followed up Aaron&rsquo;s talk and discussed how important it is to launch early (do something) and surround yourself with the best people you can.</p>
