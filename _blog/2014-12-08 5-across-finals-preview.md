<p>It’s all come down to this! On Wednesday, December 10, the five previous winners of 5 Across this year will duke it out for $5,000 in prize money. It’s going to be a great event with food and fun ways for the audience to get involved, like text voting, crowd trivia, the Freshest tweet contest, and a few exciting all-new elements. If you need a refresher on the contestants, take a look at what they’ve been up to since their last win.</p>

<p><a href="http://yousawme.com/" target="_blank">You Saw Me</a>, a member of the Awesome Inc Fellowship program, won the first 5 Across of this year with a pitch for their unique color LED reflective safety vest. Seth McBee and Kevin Winzer have been up to a lot since February, when they took home $500. They tried their hand at Kickstarter, launched a new website, and have shipped more than 200 vests. The vests, which give up to a mile of visibility to runners, cyclists or construction workers, are sure to be a success.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.completeset.com/" target="_blank">CompleteSet</a>, founded by avid collectors Gary Darna and Jaime Rump, connects collectors with new sources to improve their collections. They’ve been up to some big things, it seems, including the closing of a $650,000 seed round of investment and the launch of a 1.0 version of their product at <a href="https://www.completeset.com/" target="_blank">CompleteSet.com</a>. Gary Darna tells us why CompleteSet is such a hit: “If you&rsquo;re not a collector, you know someone who is. The most exciting thing about collecting is how popular of a hobby it has become. Thanks to The Big Bang Theory, The Walking Dead and events like San Diego Comic Con it has become acceptable to be an adult who reads comics and buys toys. These mainstream celebrations of geek culture have exploded in recent years and we&rsquo;re the online equivalent for these franchises.”</p>

<p>The winner of the third competition this year, <a href="http://www.blinkscan.com/" target="_blank">Blink Scan</a>, backed by Don Skaggs and Steve McFadden, seeks to make scanning easier and quicker by integrating intelligent solutions with high-resolution images. Behind this product is a multi-talented team with experience in consumer electronics, high-tech business solutions, and engineering professors at the University of Kentucky. The Blink Scan team will show off their speedy high-resolution scanner, and tell us what they’ve been cooking up when they get in the “shark tank” at 5 Across.<br/></p>

<p>In their first win, <a href="http://supersoul.co/" target="_blank">Super Soul Studios</a> pitched their Astronaut Kitty Boom Boom. Now they’re back, fresh off the launch of their new Playstation 4 game, Speakeasy, a multiplayer brawl game set in the Roaring ‘20s. “We love talking about games with other people. We love sharing our ideas for our company and our games. So at 5 Across you will learn about the exciting things we are doing in Lexington as part of the game industry.”</p>

<p><a href="http://vegyvida.com/" target="_blank">Vegy Vida</a> is a vegetable dip that masks the bitter tastes in veggies. In October, John Young pitched this FDA approved, patent-pending, “Febreze for vegetables”. During his pitch, John mentioned there was a big production deal in the works for November, and he anticipates having the product on shelves by spring. We hope Vegy Vida has some exciting new developments, and maybe even brings some dip for judges to try.</p>
<p>So many talented teams. But there can only be one winner. The company with the top rated pitch will walk away with $4,000 to help grow their business, and second place will receive $1,000. Plus, there will be multiple door prizes up for grabs in various crowd contests and all new elements. Sound like fun? Admission is only $5, so <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2014-5-across-finals-tickets-11506603561" target="_blank">get your ticket now</a>! Hope to see you there!</p>
