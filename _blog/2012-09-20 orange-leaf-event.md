<p>Who knew being good could be so much fun? Team Alpha had an outing to Orangeleaf this month for one of their fundraiser nights. We took advantage of a great thing that Orangeleaf already had going. Often as individuals we miss out on opportunities to be good because we don&rsquo;t know what is going on in our community.</p>
<p>Orangeleaf has started offering Monday-Wednesdays as fundraiser nights at their stores. It is a very simple process. You bring a flyer in anytime that day to help out a good cause and 25% of the sales go to the cause.</p>
<p>The fundraiser we attended on August 13th at the Tiverton location was for an Elementary aged girl with cancer. All we knew about the girl is that her name is Paige and she is sick. Even though none of us know Paige or her family personally I was very glad we gave our support to them by going to Orangeleaf that night.</p>
<p>Before the event Brian and I discussed writing encouraging notes to Paige and her family. Along with hanging out with great company, one of my favorite parts was writing cards to Paige. At the end of the night we were able to give the OL&rsquo;s manager a dozen or so cards for Paige and you could tell it was appreciated. All this recap of the night to say keep looking for ways to partner with the community to be good.</p>
