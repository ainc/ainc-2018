<p>Awesome Inc. is headed down to <a href="http://www.barcampnashville.com/" target="_blank">Nashville&rsquo;s Barcamp</a>.  &ldquo;<a href="http://www.barcamp.org/BarCamp" target="_blank">BarCamp</a> is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from participants who are the main actors of the event.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m pumped to see this 600+ person event in action and specifically the following sessions: <br/><br/></p>
<ul><li>Emerging Market: Vanity iPhone Apps for Small Businesses - Jackson Miller - #bcn09ivanity <a href="http://www.apaxsoftware.com/" target="_blank">APAX Software</a>, a company that works out of Awesome Inc. has been focusing on iPhone apps recently and has found many of their customers to be in this market of Vanity Apps. The trends Jackson sees on in this market will be beneficial to hear about.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>I AM MUSIC CITY: Entrepreneurship in Nashville - J. Tod Fetherling - #bcn09nashec As one of the people with his finger on the <a href="http://www.technologycouncil.com/" target="_blank">pulse</a> of the entrepreneurial community in Nashville, we are really interested in learning from and taking advantage of the trends and ideas that Tod sees in building entrepreneurial communities and opportunities.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul><li>State of the Community: The &lsquo;Venn Diagram&rsquo; of Nashville&rsquo;s Tech Organizations - David Ledgerwood - #bcn09venn Like Tod&rsquo;s talk, this is something that will give us a good 'lay of the land&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve ended up explaining this so many times that I&rsquo;ve ended up making a chart along these exact lines for Lexington. Interested to see how they differ.</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>Enterprise Lamp: The Next Frontier of Technical Depth In Nashville - Marcus Whitney - #bcn09elamp I heard about Marcus and what he&rsquo;s doing with Enterprise Lamp from Chuck Bryant, this year&rsquo;s Nashville Barcamp organizer, COO of <a href="http://www.borderjump.us/" target="_blank">Borderjump.us</a> and <a href="http://www.nashvillegeeks.org/" target="_blank">Nashville Geeks</a>.</li>
</ul><p><br/><br/></p>
<ul><li>iPhone Development or &ldquo;Welcome to Crazyville, Population YOU&rdquo; - Nicholas Holland - #bcn09crazyville Nick came to <a href="http://mobile.awesomeinc.org/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc&rsquo;s Mobile miniConference</a> this summer and we hung out again during<a href="http://nashvillestartup.ning.com/" target="_blank">Nashville Startup Weekend</a>. His iPhone app Mobile Assassins was a year in the making so I&rsquo;m interested to hear all the ups and downs he&rsquo;s experienced in the past twelve months. If it took that long to get this app in the store, he&rsquo;s probably faced every hurdle there is.</li>
</ul>
