<p>For those of you who do not know who I am, I am Awesome Inc&rsquo;s D.O.G. (Director of Good). I talked with Brian, one of the founders, about pursuing this opportunity with Awesome Inc back in May after plans I made to travel out of the country had fallen through. In hindsight I am very grateful for this change in plans. After a few meetings talking about Awesome Inc and Core Value #1 I found myself so excited about helping people live with honesty, integrity, and serving others that I would wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it.</p>
<p>Since I have been at Ainc one thing that has been completely clear is the founders&rsquo; security with their principles and believing wholeheartedly in their mission. They set in place <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/four-pillars-of-awesome" target="_blank">these core values</a>, Be Good, Be Excellent, Be a Friend, and Be You. They live each of these out on a daily basis and lead others to do the same. The Ainc culture to me is a result of these four values together.</p>
<p>I would like to narrow in on Core Value # 1: Be Good.</p>
<p>• Live with honesty &amp; integrity: a. Honesty – Tell the truth b. Integrity - Have moral principles and follow them c. Emulate people of character</p>
<p>• Serve others: a. Be a good &amp; selfless person b. Use your life to benefit the world c. It&rsquo;s about the product; not about you</p>
<p>To me Core Value #1 Be Good is all about being intentional on developing the person you are becoming. Everyone is in the process of becoming someone; not everyone however is aware or consciously directing who they are becoming. As the director of good I have formed my own personal definition of good, personal metrics, and business metrics that all align. This has challenged my way of thinking and inspired me to actively decide what kind of person I want to be. I have the privilege to encourage others to invest in the same exercise. After reflecting on what I do value I have been inspired to set metrics based on my beliefs and personal definition of good instead of letting my metrics ultimately determine what I am communicating my definition of good is. I am convinced that everyone would be much happier if they would let their metrics define their life instead of letting their life define their metrics or lack thereof.</p>
<p>In conclusion I am inspired to know of a place that truly reflects their values and mission. Awesome Inc, keep being good and continuing to define what that means!</p>
<p>Your D. O. G.</p>
