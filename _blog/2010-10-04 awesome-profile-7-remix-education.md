<p>Remix Education (<a href="http://remixeducation.com/" target="_blank">remixeducation.com</a>) provides motivational assemblies at schools and churches using interactive mascot performances. Each assembly is tailored to the particular group, but some topics are antidrug, anti bullying, and the Gospel. The programs are a fun, entertaining way to educate kids about living better and healthier.</p>
<p>Remix Education programs are for kids of any grade. While available at any place they are wanted or needed, they currently work mainly in Kentucky. The hope in the near future is to expand to other states and eventually go on mission trips to other countries. Remix Education wants to have the opportunities to impact more people and spread the Gospel.</p>
<p>Members of Remix Education include Matt and Jenny Hogg and Butch Vernon. The Hoggs were inspired by the Gospel and a love of kids and entertaining to start Remix Education. Matt has been a mascot for several teams and Jenny is a cheerleader, which are skills they use to pump students up and motivate them.</p>
