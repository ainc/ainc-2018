<p>In the <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/whats-your-ss-ratio" target="_blank">previous article</a>, I explain what your S:S (&lsquo;Stuff&rsquo;:Substance) is and how important it is to keep yours low, meaning don&rsquo;t embellish your past accomplishments or current successes.</p>
<p>However, while this may make people trust you more, they won&rsquo;t necessarily be apt to do business with you&hellip;especially if you&rsquo;re reaching for a client, sponsor, employee, etc. that normally associates with businesses that are bigger, older, more established, etc.</p>
<p>So how do you keep your S:S low and still successfully reach 'up&rsquo; in the business world?</p>
<p>Get really comfortable and confident about this gap between where you are/what you&rsquo;ve done and where you want to get to.</p>
<p>So in practice, go ahead and be overconfident but always answer questions about specifics with no hesitancy, no apology, a deep enough understanding of your situation to show that you&rsquo;re aware of the obstacles and odds keeping you from success, and most importantly&hellip;.the same level of confidence as when you were matter-of-factly describing your plans to kick Google&rsquo;s ass.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called congruence â€“ and it&rsquo;s something that everybody is attracted to&hellip;and in some cases even more so than an established 'company&rsquo; or 'brand&rsquo; (<a href="http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/business-a-reflection-of-personalities" target="_blank">both of which are just made up of the human being that represents them</a> )&hellip;.which is where you&rsquo;re going to find those first contacts that help get you to the next level.</p>
