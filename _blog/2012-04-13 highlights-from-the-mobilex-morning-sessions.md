<p>The breakout sessions have been going on all morning. There are several tracks attendees can choose from: entrepreneur, technical, marketing &amp; social media, and a mobile development workshop. Here are a few highlights from the morning sessions:</p>
<p>Anthony Hand (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/anthonyhand" target="_blank">@anthonyhand</a>) presented &ldquo;Opportunities for Mobile Innovation: A Designer&rsquo;s Perspective&rdquo;. Hand is a user experience designer at Samsung Research. According to Hand, &ldquo;Facebook&rsquo;s already won. But there are a lot of niches that Facebook doesn&rsquo;t fill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of these niches is filled by Instagram. The app allows users to photoshop and share photos from their phone to Facebook. Draw Something is another app that fills a niche. It debuted in February and already has over 35 million downloads. The key to success for both is the social component. To have a successful app, you must &ldquo;build social from the ground up; don&rsquo;t bolt it on at the end. [&hellip;] User experience makes or breaks an app.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kerry Carter (<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/kerrycarter8" target="_blank">@kerrycarter8</a>) presented the &ldquo;Intersection of Sports and Technology: Mobile Trends for One Person Brands&rdquo;. Carter is a former NFL player turned mobile entrepreneur; he owns <a href="http://www.vivavision.com/" target="_blank">Viva Vision</a>, a mobile software company.</p>
<p>According to Carter, the average NFL career is 3.2 years and 80% of NFL players are divorced or in financial trouble 2 years after their careers end. He was looking for a way to successfully transition out of football. Since he studied anthropology in college, Carter now considers himself a &ldquo;digital anthropologist&rdquo; the six months out of the year he&rsquo;s not playing for the Canada Football League.</p>
<p>His strategy is taking his sports fan following and leveraging that in business, like Shaquille O'Neal did. However, investors are wary of athletes so he has to bring a strong business to the table. He says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the number of followers, it&rsquo;s how engaged they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Carter&rsquo;s best advice is, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re going to take a risk, take a risk on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Josh Silverman, founder of <a href="http://www.studyegg.com/users/sign_in" target="_blank">StudyEgg</a>, said during a panel session that it is important to decide if you are mobile first or web first. His company originally tried to be both, but you have to pick one and make that your focus until it works.</p>
