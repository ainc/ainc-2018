<p>On Tuesday I went up to Cincinnati for one of the first <a href="http://www.cincycoworks.com/" target="_blank">Cincy Coworks</a> day of coworking. I realized the strength and vibrancy of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky entrepreneurial culture a <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/2009/09/27/start-a-business-with-100-people-in-3-days/" target="_blank">few weeks ago</a> at <a href="http://www.inoneweekend.org/" target="_blank">In One Weekend</a>, but I hadn&rsquo;t seen a semi-permanent gathering of people getting together to do their own thing&hellip;until now. I ended up at <a href="http://venue222.com/" target="_blank">Venue 222</a> around noon, not knowing at all what I&rsquo;d find.</p>
<p>I was quickly and pleasantly surprised to see art on the walls, a ping pong table upstairs, and a bunch of cool people doing awesome stuff. Here are just a few of them:</p>
<p>Gerard Sychay &amp; Bill Barnett - These guys are the founders of Cincy Coworks - which right now is an occasional gathering of freelancers doing their own thing. Their &ldquo;mission as a professional community hub is to transform how people in Cincinnati with ideas get together and make the region a better place to live.&rdquo; I got to sit on some bean bags with them for awhile and talk about&hellip;you guessed it&hellip;.Awesome stuff! In this case that ended up being the visions we had for the things we were doing and why we were doing them. These guys are both trying to do something that will really benefit their community and they&rsquo;re doing it for the &lsquo;right&rsquo; reasons. Hats off fellas!</p>
<p>Chris - After mentioning some of the things we&rsquo;re doing at <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/the-awesome-space/labs/" target="_blank">Awesome Labs</a>, Chris insisted that I check out a hackerspace close by called <a href="http://www.hive13.org/" target="_blank">Hive13</a>. Really cool looking place with some neat toys. Thanks for taking the time to drive me over there Chris!</p>
<p>Everyone that ever worked at <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/www.zipscene.com" target="_blank">zipscene.com</a> - Actually I just met Colin. Gerard works there too, but I already told you about him ;)</p>

<p><a href="http://kristaneher.com/" target="_blank">Krista</a> from <a href="http://bootcampmobile.com/" target="_blank">Bootcamp Mobile</a> (among other things) - Krista and I had already met a few times before, so it was a pleasant surprise to get to see her again. We connected first while I was reaching out to local mobile experts for the <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/www.mobile.awesomeinc.org" target="_blank">Mobile miniConference</a> we had this summer, and then I got to hang out with her again at InOneWeekend.</p>
<p>There were plenty more people there, and overall the event was a huge success and a great time. Thanks Gerard and Bill and keep up the good work. Just don&rsquo;t forget Rule #4 - Always do something awesome over something not awesome!</p>
