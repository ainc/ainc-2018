<p>If you&rsquo;re familiar with us, you have heard our mission a million times. Not only are we a coworking space, art gallery, event venue and creative laboratory, but our primary focus is to take people and small companies with ideas and help them develop something Awesome. Our goal is to help bring success to companies and communities through every means possible by nurturing creativity, sharing technological prowess, and inspiring entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<p>One way that we do that is through our annual summer-long startup accelerator program: The Awesome Inc Experience. This year, The Awesome Inc Experience is putting three companies through the trials and tribulations of founding and operating a startup. Pivots, drama, failures and successes, sweat and emotion are not short in supply at this point in the program. The space has had a truly electric energy about it for the past five weeks.</p>
<p>The teams which are calling Awesome Inc their home for the summer are:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Jim Wombles</strong> - Fanbouts.com is re-imagining sports media for the 21st century. We are a social community of sports fans that curate the news, images, and videos that fans post to the site. With fanbouts, only the most popular and relevant topics are voted to the front page.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Michael Ward, Bryce Perry, Mac Glidewell, Ben Wilson</strong> - Tag-A-Pet is a company working to solve the problem of lost pets. Tag-A-pet centers around a smart tag, located on the pet&rsquo;s collar, that is scannable by any capable smartphone. After the tag is scanned, the user is directed to the pet&rsquo;s profile containing pet and owner information, as well as, secure pet medical records.</li>
</ul><ul><li><strong>Nick Jordan, Kyle Vaughn, Sam Blake</strong> - RateMyRental is an aid to college students during their search for adequate housing with the Rate My Rental. Through an online platform, RateMyRental, allows students to easily access information concerning area housing by viewing property listings around their college campus alongside reviews of previous tenants.</li>
</ul><p>The program offers <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/experiencebenefits" target="_blank">benefits</a> including mentorship, work space, startup coaching, a small stipend, and various other resources.
