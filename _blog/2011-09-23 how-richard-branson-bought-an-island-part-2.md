<p><strong>Part 2 – Courage – Asking Like You Mean It</strong></p>
<p>This is a continuation from <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/how-richard-branson-bought-an-island-part-1" target="_blank">part 1</a>.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Richard&rsquo;s story</strong></p>
<p>Richard had discovered that some of the British Virgin Islands are for sale. He went on holiday to visit them and see if he&rsquo;d like to purchase one, despite not having nearly enough money to afford one.</p>
<p>After a handful of beautiful but not life-changing visits to other islands, Richard landed on Necker Island, 74 acres of dense, lush foliage, wildlife, uninterrupted beach all around and a hill in the middle that allows you to see the whole island from one place. He fell in love with it</p>
<p>He returned to the helicopter after a trip around the island and asked about the seller and the price. The seller turned out to be Lord Cobham and the price $5,000,000.</p>
<p>Now, to many people that would have been the bubble-bursting moment. After all, Virgin still owed banks thousands of dollars. But it didn&rsquo;t slow Richard down; he was too excited and too convinced that he would find a way to get that island. So he started by making a bid&hellip;.of $100,000 (that&rsquo;s 98% less than the asking price, by the way).</p>
<p>Not only was he turned down but he was immediately forced to leave the island! However, upon his return to England, he continued to negotiate and to raise the money he needed to pay for the island.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson #2: When you ask, ask like you mean it - and really mean it. This takes courage.</strong></p>
<p>Richard knew he was making a ridiculous offer. He knew it was so low that it would upset the owner. But that didn&rsquo;t keep him from negotiating from a place of absolute sincerity and courage.You not only have to put yourself in a place where you will be heard, you have to make an ask that you are sincere about - no matter how ridiculous the other side might think it is.</p>
<p><strong>My Story: Having the Courage to ask Samsung for One Million Dollars</strong></p>
<p>I have a friend that runs a creative advertising company. He was going to do a deal with Samsung about building Times Square in Second Life. At the time there were millions of active users on Second Life (an online 3D virtual reality world that mimicked the physical world) and the idea was that once Samsung had my friend&rsquo;s company build Times Square, they would be able to control the advertising on it (just like the real Times Square).</p>
<p>My friend sat down at the table with the CEO of Samsung, in their office in New York City, looked him straight in the eye and said &ldquo;We will build this for you for $1,000,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CEO came back with an offer of $25,000. My friend didn&rsquo;t budge – even though his company only had three people in it and had been around for just three years. The tension in the room was high. The CEO refused to get anywhere near my friend&rsquo;s bid and vice versa.</p>
<p>At this point you might be thinking: &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s Samsung and you&rsquo;re just a small business. You should jump at the opportunity because they are such a well known company!&rdquo; But my friend wasn&rsquo;t kidding when he asked for that $1,000,000; he really believed that his service was worth that much. Whether you or Samsung agree with this line of reasoning doesn&rsquo;t matter. What matters is that my friend felt this way and stuck to it&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;and walked away from the deal completely. He told Samsung no.</p>
<p>A few months later he ended up doing an innovative project with Ford Motor Company for full price.</p>
<p><strong>What Richard and My Advertising Friend are Teaching Us</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are &lsquo;asking big&rsquo; out of principle like my friend, or because it&rsquo;s all you have to work with, like Richard, the point is that you have to be serious. You have to mean it. You have to stick to it if you want to maintain mutual respect in the deal. That&rsquo;s not to say you can&rsquo;t get creative, but you need to know what you are going to ask and why before you open your mouth.</p>
<p>If you were to get 15 minutes of Bill Gates&rsquo;s time to pitch him your software product would you finish and then offer to sell it to him for $10,000,000, even if that is 100 times more than you&rsquo;ve ever charged anyone? If you were trying to talk Sony into becoming a supplier at your retail store and you finally got an offer from them, would you be willing to ask for 50% off and mean it if you thought it was the right thing to do?</p>
<p>Asking big and meaning it takes courage, but why? Most people would say it&rsquo;s because the person or company might say no. That might be part of it, but I think it&rsquo;s not the most important part. The thing that I think scares us the most and therefore forces us to summon more courage than we think we can, is what you would be called upon to do if the other side actually says &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to your request.</p>
<p>In the third part of this series we&rsquo;ll be looking at the final piece of Richard&rsquo;s Necker Island story as well as the story of how I ended up being homeless for most of 2009 and 2010.</p>
