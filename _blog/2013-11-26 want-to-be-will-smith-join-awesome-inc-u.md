<p>It’s a pretty well-known fact that speaking many languages makes you cooler. Bradley Cooper, Will Smith, and Charlize Theron are just a handful of multilingual celebrities. I also speak multiple languages, English and Tagalog, but it’s totally up to you whether you think I’m cool or not. I’ve been around both languages my entire life so learning them came naturally. However, I’ve been around one language for all my life but I still don’t know how to “speak” it. That language is HTML. It’s one of the most common languages used for web development and can be found anywhere on the Internet. </p>
<p><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></p>
<p>Taking a class at <a href="http://www.awesomeincu.com/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc U</a> is going to change that. Awesome Inc U is offering a crash course in Basic Web Development, which will teach HTML among other things. The class will be held on December 7th from 12pm to 6pm. Prices are $50 for students and $100 for non-students. The class is open to all skill levels so all you need to bring is a computer and your smiling face. Nick Such and Brian Raney will be the instructors for this edition of Awesome Inc U. Coding is all around us and Awesome Inc U is there to help you learn it, one class at a time.</p>
