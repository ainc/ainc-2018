<p>Helping fulfill Awesome Inc’s mission to create and grow local high-tech startups, the Awesome Fellowship program is designed to give startups access to a mentor network of more than sixty entrepreneurial experts, free office space, and an in-house graphic designer and web developer dedicated to growing each company with Awesome Inc <a href="http://blog.awesomeinc.org/post/65084038765/four-pillars-of-awesome" target="_blank">values</a> in mind. These resources are used to accelerate the growth of early stage startups participating in the program. There is a <a href="http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org/apply.html" target="_blank">rolling application process</a> and the Fellowship is always accepting applications. The Fellowship is supported in part by the Cabinet of Economic Development. We have also received support and partnered with key people in the community such as Sizemore &amp; Sizemore accounting firm, Dinsmore &amp; Shohl law firm, and angel investor Chris Young.</p>
<p>In March, we chronicled three teams in the <a href="http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org/" target="_blank">Awesome Fellowship</a> <a href="http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org/" target="_blank">Program</a>: Control My ADHD, You Saw Me, and Custom College Recruiting. This month we are providing a snapshot of their progress. After checking in with them, it is evident that all teams are making great progress!</p>
<ul><li>
<p><a href="http://yousawme.com" target="_blank">You Saw Me</a> founder, Seth McBee, made tremendous strides over the last few months including hiring a volume textile manufacturer, winning several pitch competitions, and securing $25,000 from the Bluegrass Angels. As recently as a week ago Seth was making each vest by hand. Although you can still find him wiring up vests by the Ping Pong table with the help of other members of Awesome Inc, textile professionals were able to offer new suggestion on materials. Seth says working around other members of Awesome Inc gives him “inspiration and energy to work harder.”  The Fellowship has allowed Seth to connect with mentors and he too has reciprocated that assistance by helping coach presenters at 5 Across. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.controlmyadhd.com" target="_blank">Control My ADHD</a> founder, Grant Weherley, recently released a new course and the month of March posted the best revenue figures thus far. He is also focusing on different partnership opportunities to offer the course to people who need it the most. Currently, Grant is working from the Philippines and credits the Fellowship for allowing him to “focus more on the big things like moving the company forward without stressing about side issues like figuring out how to use Photoshop.” The Fellowship aims to allow entrepreneurs to allocate their energy into what is most vital. In Grant’s case, that means helping to remove ADHD as an obstacle in millions of adults and sharing that vision.</p>

<p>Shane Howard, founder of <a href="http://www.customcollegerecruiting.com" target="_blank">Custom College Recruiting</a>, has been continuing his mission to ease the recruitment process for student-athletes and coaches. He is currently in Australia helping athletes there access scholarships stateside with CCR. Meanwhile the company has added two new full-time employees and raised a seed round of funding. Shane is able to help student-athletes worldwide not only continue playing competitively beyond high school, but also secure scholarships for them. </p>
</li>
</ul><p>These companies have made measurable progress in growing their companies. We are excited see them enter the next stages of their startup development and are working hard to help them get there!</p>
