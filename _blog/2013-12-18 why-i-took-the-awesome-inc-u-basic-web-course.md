<p>When I started as part of <a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org/get-involved.html" target="_blank">Team Alpha</a> at Awesome Inc, I had no clue what kind of things that I would be doing. I knew that I was there to learn, but I had no clue how absolutely brilliant and driven all the people there were. But one thing always stood out as a crucial background of Awesome Inc: coding and programming.</p>

<p>Whoa, I felt behind, because I had never taken one class or learned anything about it. It was just a foreign language that I didn’t feel like I needed to know, simply because I felt like it wasn’t my area of expertise, nor would it ever be. As a few months progressed, I realized that my wanting to learn how to code wasn’t coming from any sort of pressure, it came from the excitement that Awesome Inc provides.</p>

<p>When you’re at Awesome Inc, you tell someone of your work, and they reply, “Awesome”, it makes me smile. Awesome Inc exists to create an awesome environment, so when I found myself itching to learn and be part of a community that knows how to do these amazing things, I couldn’t have been more proud to be part of this place.</p>

<p>I took that itch to learn how to code and finally signed up for the <a href="http://www.awesomeincu.com/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc U</a> Basic Web Development Course. Again, I had never tried to learn how to do this kind of stuff before. I didn’t know what any of it meant or how people even understood it. All I knew was that I wanted to have some sort of understanding of what it all was.</p>

<p>That Saturday, I was kind of nervous because I thought that everyone would know more than me and I’d fall behind, but full of hope and enthusiasm, I had a blast at the class and learned more than I ever thought possible. It turns out that the basics of this supposed language isn’t that difficult! Granted, I took an introductory class, but at least having a grasp of what was going on made me feel like I could do something with it and really apply it. A couple hours of learning and having fun reminded me of why I love being a part of Team Alpha and the overall Awesome Inc community. Everyone, no matter what, is here to grow as a person and as an intellect, and that’s what being awesome is all about.</p>
