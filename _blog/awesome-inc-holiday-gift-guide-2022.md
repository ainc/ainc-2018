description: A curated list from the Awesome Inc team to help you be the best
  gift-giver this year!
---
Who among us doesn’t wish they were the best gift-giver in the family? There are few better feelings than seeing a genuinely excited reaction when your gift is opened. But if you, like me, have no idea what to buy and have crippling decision paralysis, or maybe you know what gifts you would like but have no clue what your mom, dad, sister, brother, uncle, cousin, or special someone wants, this gift guide is for you! And you don’t even have to tell anyone where you got the ideas - it’s our little secret.



Our team has curated a list of some of our favorite gifts from all over the spectrum from techie to analog and thrifty to luxurious, all for you to browse at your leisure. Enjoy!



[Samsung WH-1000XM5 over ear headphones](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-wh-1000xm5-wireless-noise-canceling-over-the-ear-headphones-black/6505727.p?skuId=6505727&ref=212&loc=1&ref=212&loc=1&gclsrc=ds)

For years, Sony has been making some of the best over-ear headphones on the market, and this year they released the newly revamped WH-1000XM5. While the name may be terrible, the sound quality and noise cancellation in a crowded workspace is as good as it gets.

[Ember Mug](https://ember.com/products/ember-mug-2?variant=30843977760853) 

There’s never a good time to take a sip from a cold cup of coffee (unless you made it that way). Thankfully for you, the Ember Mug keeps your drink of choice at the temperature of your choice. Never have a luke-warm drink again!

[Solo Stove Ranger 2.0](https://www.solostove.com/en-us/p/solo-stove-ranger)

Indulge in fireside experiences without the inconvenience of a smoky flame. Solo Stove’s signature 360-degree airflow super-heats air to burn off smoke before it can get to your clothes or hair. And without that pesky “post-fire” smell, teary eyes, or a game of musical chairs to dodge smoke, you can enjoy ultimate warmth without sacrificing comfort.

[Record Player](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NC86ZQN/)

There’s something special about listening to your favorite music played on vinyl. We’re pretty sure scientists even say that record players guarantee more head-bobs per minute than any other music device. Don’t argue with science, just enjoy your music the best way possible!

[Plastic Playing Cards](https://www.amazon.com/Playing-Waterproof-Plastic-Printed-Orange/dp/B07YFCH1QM/)

Sometimes it’s the simplest improvements that stick with you. Once you shuffle up a set of plastic playing cards, you’ll never turn back. Plus, they’re waterproof, so you can play in a hot tub, or in a quiet pub, without worrying about waterlogged cards.

[Blockbuster Party Game](https://www.amazon.com/Blockbuster-Game-Movie-Party-Family/dp/B07WMWNYNN/)

If you’re old enough to remember going to Blockbuster on a Friday, the nostalgia alone might be worth buying the game for. However, the Blockbuster Party Game stands alone as a great game “for anyone who has ever seen a movie.” Easy to learn, set up, and play, it’s a perfect group game to pull out at the next family party.

[Kindle Paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-adjustable-Ad-Supported/dp/B08KTZ8249/)

You might be thinking “but I love the feel of a book, I couldn’t possibly switch to an e-reader,” and I’d say you have a point. But once you experience the joy and ease of reading while laying on your side in a dark room, not having to worry about holding open a thick book or turning on a reading-light, you’ll be hooked. Lightweight, portable, water resistant, and enough storage to fit more books than you can read in years - the Kindle Paperwhite is the perfect gift for any bibliophile you know.

[Bluetooth Shower Speaker](https://www.amazon.com/WONDERBOOM-Bluetooth-360-Degree-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B09KX6RT7Q)

If you’re showering in silence, you’re missing out on prime podcast, music, and audiobook time! You could be getting smarter every morning, instead of mindlessly going through the motions while you stare at the drain. With great sound quality, and an IP67 dust and water resistance rating, you can party at the beach and bring it back to the shower without ever missing a track.
