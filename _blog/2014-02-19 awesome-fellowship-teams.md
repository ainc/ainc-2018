<p>A lot of people have awesome ideas.</p>

<p>A lot of people have awesome ideas they want to turn into an awesome business.</p>

<p>But very few people can say that they have all the resources they need to get their ideas off the ground, let alone shape them into a successful brand.</p>

<p>Enter the Awesome Fellowship. Introduced this fall, the program aims to grow 6-10 high-tech startups in Lexington in the year 2014. Companies are selected for the program through the <a>online application</a> process. Selected teams receive access to the mentorship network, introductions to investors, and access to the Fellowship’s own graphic designer and programmer. The Awesome Fellowship is supported in part by <a href="http://bizlex.com/2013/11/state-grants-37500-to-awesome-inc/" target="_blank">a grant from the Cabinet of Economic Development</a>.</p>

<p>The Fellowship has so far accepted three startup teams into the program: Control My ADHD, You Saw Me, and Custom College Recruiting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.controlmyadhd.com/" target="_blank">Control My ADHD</a>, in the words of founder Grant Weherley, “focus[es] on positive, proactive methods that allow people to take ‘control’ of having ADHD, rather than just being labeled as having a ‘disability.’” Weherley explains that, while not intending to replace medical treatment, his company hopes to provide alternatives for those who find medication or other methods inadequate. In addition to helping affected individuals control their symptoms, Weherley also strives to make an impact on a larger scale. “I see my company helping shape societal perspective towards ADHD several positive ways, while training large numbers of people on simple, everyday methods for improving symptoms, so they can really take ownership of their ADHD,” says Weherley,  “rather than feeling disabled by it.” Weherley adds that the most valuable service the Fellowship has provided has been “having an entrepreneurial community backing my project and to reach out to;” furthermore the design and programming assistance has been extremely helpful as well.      </p>

<p>Also new to the Fellowship is <a href="http://yousawme.com/" target="_blank">You Saw Me</a>, headed by Seth McBee. You Saw Me is focused on “making visibility safety active, custom, fun for walkers, runners, bicyclists, and anyone wanting to be bright.” The company markets reflective safety vests with the added visibility of color-customizable embedded LEDs. After recently moving to Lexington in order to focus full-time on his company, Seth was drawn to the Fellowship as an opportunity to grow it into the brand he envisions. “Awesome Inc naturally came up as a resource,” says Seth.  “Their excitement for those with the passion to go from idea to concept to market really drew me in and their willingness to help me is why I&rsquo;m still there.” Of the benefits of being a part of the Fellowship, Seth says, “I&rsquo;ve realized there are tons that go into producing a brand new consumer good and it&rsquo;s hard to be flawless throughout.  The ability to use experts for things I wouldn&rsquo;t call myself close at has been extremely valuable in allowing me to do what I am good at, all while maintaining that powerful image I plan on building.  So far, this has been web development, graphic design, and on-the-spot mentoring.”   </p>

<p>The third company currently a part of the program is <a href="http://www.customcollegerecruiting.com/" target="_blank">Custom College Recruiting</a>. Founded in 2010 by former collegiate basketball coach Shane Howard, CCR aims to “get [prospective college basketball] players what they truly need in the recruiting process. Education, evaluation, and exposure.” The service helps student athletes across the United States and the world get noticed by college coaches in both NCAA and NAIA divisions.  By consistently sending a scouting report&ndash;including basic stats and video of the player&ndash;multiple times per month to coaches, “the idea is that if a coach overlooks or misses the info one week, but may in fact have an interest ultimately, then they will eventually see it,” explains CCR’s website.  Shane, drawing from personal experience, says, “I was coaching at a small college and found that there was really no way for players to properly evaluate their abilities and verify their talents to college coaches,” a void which CCR now helps fill. Shane hopes to see CCR continue to grow into a leading recruiting service and says that “having a great support group of proven winners in the startup space” has been the most valuable part of his participation in the Fellowship.</p>

<p>It has been great welcoming these teams into the Awesome Inc community, and we are excited to do the same for even more in the near future.</p>
