<p>On April 10th, 2013, <a href="http://www.commercelexington.com/" target="_blank">Commerce Lexington</a> hosted &ldquo;Get That Awesome Job,&rdquo; an event organized by Awesome Inc&rsquo;s own Hollis Gargala. The event welcomed Herb Miller, president of Columbia Gas of Kentucky, Cyndy Harbett Miller, Senior Lecturer and Director of the Department of Communications at the University of Kentucky, Brandi Howard, Staffing Consultant at <a href="http://www.manpower.com/" target="_blank">Manpower</a>, and Brian Raney, founder of Awesome Inc. Nick Such, Director of Awesome Labs, moderated the discussion.</p>
<p>More than twenty five people were in attendance. The expert panel fielded many questions pertaining to best practices in getting jobs with companies, including proper ways to make contact with organizations through the actual interviews. After the panel discussion was over, questions were taken from the audience. There were many insightful questions expanding upon ideas and suggestions discussed earlier in the event. A meet and greet session capped off the night, where the audience was able to network with the speakers and ask questions one on one.</p>
