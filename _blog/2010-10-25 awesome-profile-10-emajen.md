<p>Emajen (<a href="http://emajenanything.com/" target="_blank">http://emajenanything.com</a>) is a web service provider that provides web development, design, and marketing. They help small to medium businesses and advertisement agencies to gain and maintain a web presence through tools like local search business listings, search engine optimization, and social media integration. While their clients stretch from New Jersey to Alaska, they are mainly in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Emajen is working developing relationships with advertising agencies so they can focus on their actual product and not on marketing and selling it. One of their current projects is a software platform for publication magazines. They are creating a social realm members can access on a subscription basis.</p>
<p>Owner Jarod Thornton started with a business partner, but he had his own ideas how to run a company and was inspired to start his own. He created Emajen in March 2010. His biggest challenge has been balancing his personal and work life, because it&rsquo;s been easy to get involved in one and forget the other.</p>
