<p>Get ready for the big question. The question that, right or wrong, people will judge you by.  People will subconsciously categorize you by your answer to this question. People will feel like they know who you are because of your answer. What sort of question could elicit such a response? No, nothing about religion, marital status or whether or not you eat tofu. The question is: “So, what do you do?” A person isn’t asking what your hobbies are, what you do for fun on the weekends, or even what your contribution to the betterment of mankind is; they want to know what kind of work you do. Believe it or not, this can actually be a golden opportunity to “sell” someone on your ideas, products, and services. A finely crafted elevator pitch will allow you to best market yourself and your venture whenever you are asked this pivotal question.</p>
<p> An elevator pitch is a short, concise representation of what it is that you do. It is named after the amount of time you would have to make a short presentation during a ride on an elevator. This pitch should be under 1 minute, but probably closer to 30 seconds to make sure you keep the other person’s attention.The elevator pitch should center around your company’s main purpose. For example, if you build houses, make sure that the other person understands that is what you do. It is important to highlight how your product or service is different from competitors and why that makes yours better (e.g. why the way you build houses should be chosen over other options). It is also crucial that you convey passion and excitement about what you’re pitching. Is selling dog blankets exciting for you? Express that in your pitch. Give the other person enough information so that they understand what it is that you do, and how it can benefit them. Make sure you ask them a question or give them an opening to ask you about your product or service. Finally, smile when you are giving your elevator pitch. Smiling can have a mood boosting effect on others.</p>
<p>Are you looking for a job, have a startup, or maybe still in school? If so, make it a habit to talk to people and inform them about you and what you’re looking for. Even a student can give an elevator pitch to try and find summer work or an internship. If you are in sales an elevator pitch should be a very important tool in your arsenal &ndash; use it and you will certainly receive more leads.</p>
<p>Follow the steps below to create your own elevator pitch.</p>
<p>1.  <span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Briefly detail your main goal with your product or service</p>
<p>2.  <span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Explain why your idea, service or product is better than the competitors</p>
<p>3.  <span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Express your passion through the pitch</p>
<p>4.  <span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>30 seconds to 1 minute</p>
<p>5.  <span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Practice your pitch (time yourself)</p>
<p>6.  <span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Smile, smile, smile</p>
<p>7.  <span class="Apple-tab-span"> </span>Don’t forget, you’ve already come this far, ask for his or her input. You are not trying to “close” a sale on a person with an elevator pitch rather gauging their level of interest.</p>
<p>Below is a sample elevator pitch for a fake company, Widgets-R-Us, that builds mobile applications for schools.</p>
<p>“Our company, Widgets-R-Us, solves a need for instant communication between parents and faculty at grade schools through high schools all throughout the tri-state area. Since many of us here at Widgets-R-Us are parents as well, we understand the need to know and be updated when there is a school emergency, meeting or cancelation as soon as possible. With our apps, we can connect parents with faculty and allow them to relay information about non urgent matters such as school game highlights and scores, contact information, and changes in curriculum. We can also allow feedback from parents on items such as changes to the dress code. Do you know any parents or teachers that would find that useful?”</p>
