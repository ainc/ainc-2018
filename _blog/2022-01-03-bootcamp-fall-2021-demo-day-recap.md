By Stephen Ruh

It's been less than a month since the finish of our latest Web Developer Bootcamp (our 11th!), and we are excited for you to see how far these all-stars have come. Demo day was Dec 15th and most of our graduates already have job offers from local and national tech employers.

We’re always impressed by the backgrounds of our learners before bootcamp, and this group doesn't disappoint. They've been teachers, students, salesmen, and chemists. They've helped run small businesses, or even have plans to start their own. And now they know how to turn ideas into plans, plans into code, and code into software solutions for real-world problems.

Our Demo Days have looked different over the past couple of years, but this event was a welcome return to form for us, with over 100 in-person attendees. As a result, our networking portion was so packed we had traffic jams in our space; an exciting problem after a couple of Zoom-call-filled years.  For those who missed it, we want to give a recap of our most successful Demo Day yet, so let's dive into these student demos

## The Demo List
