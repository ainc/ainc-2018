<p>One of the pictures on the break room wall at Awesome Inc is of Tom Perkins. I would speculate that most of my friends don&rsquo;t know of Tom Perkins. Most of them probably don&rsquo;t even know of his venture capital firm<a href="http://www.kpcb.com/" target="_blank">Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers</a>, (KPCB) which happens to be one of the first and most successful VC firms in Silicon Valley. Of course my friends heads will turn when you mention some of the companies in the KPCB portfolio: Google, Amazon, Compaq. Tom Perkins is just one of the almost forty entrepreneurial rock stars on our wall at Awesome Inc.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Redefining the definition of &ldquo;awesome&quot;¬ù has been a core mission of Awesome Inc since we opened the doors almost a year ago. Whether it&rsquo;s through <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/2009/12/29/celebrating-victory/" target="_blank">rewarding success</a>, <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/2009/12/18/how-to-get-people-to-fail-more/" target="_blank">encouraging failure</a>, or <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/2010/01/19/awesome-inc-welcomes-in-the-team-alpha-spring-class-of-2010/" target="_blank">recruiting all-stars</a>, we plan to change the social norm. Awesome Inc is working to provide an environment where if you aren&rsquo;t doing something innovative, starting your own business or building something of value, you&rsquo;re the odd one out. It&rsquo;s about creating a culture where hard work, innovation, and taking risks are not only encouraged, but rewarded.</p>

<p>Everyone on our rock star wall has done something &quot;awesome&rdquo;. Not in the sense that they are famous for what they&rsquo;ve done, but rather that they took on insurmountable odds and took ridiculous chances where failure seemed not only probable, but almost certain. And they all did it in pursuit of their own definition of awesome.</p>

<p>People like Larry Page &amp; Sergey Brin who redefined the internet search engine with the creation of Google.</p>
<p>People like Ralph G. Anderson whose <a href="http://belcan.com/" target="_blank">company</a>, Belcan, made only $200 in the first three years, but later went onto employ 4,000 people and earns $250 Mil annually.</p>
<p>People like David Cohen of <a href="http://www.techstars.org/" target="_blank">Techstars</a> and Paul Graham of <a href="http://ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Y Combinator</a> who are currently changing the way investments are made in startups.</p>
<p>People like Lee Todd who chose challenge over comfort every step of the way from his small town in Earlington, KY, to Murray, to UK, to MIT, to launching a company that was later sold to IBM.</p>
<p>People like Jack Welch who worked his way up from junior engineer to become CEO of GE.</p>

<p>These are just some of the names that make up the wall of rock stars, their picture forming a giant &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rdquo; on the walls at Awesome Inc.</p>

<p>So, while our rock stars may not be like your rock stars (rule #2, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqLPHrCQr2I&amp;feature=player_embedded" target="_blank">Intel, 2009</a>) they do have one in thing in common: they are changing the world.</p>
