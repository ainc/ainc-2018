<p>Over the past few years, Team Alpha has had a chance to contribute to some pretty important projects at Awesome Inc. Naturally, we interns embody Awesome Inc’s values in and out of the building, so it isn’t surprising when someone does something awesome. In this case, fellow <a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org/team-alpha/" target="_blank">Team Alpha member Austin Magsig </a>will be graduating this week from Tates Creek High School as class valedictorian. Talk about <a href="http://blog.awesomeinc.org/post/65084038765/four-pillars-of-awesome" target="_blank">Core Value #2</a> (Be Excellent)! Austin upholds this in pretty much everything he does. Whether it’s web development, skunking fellow Team Alpha members in table tennis, or critiquing hip-hop, Team Alpha can always trust him to kill it. While Austin will be headed off to pastures anew at Boston University, we are proud to always call him one of ours at Awesome Inc!</p>
