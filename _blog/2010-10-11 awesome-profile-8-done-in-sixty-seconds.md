<p>Done in Sixty Seconds (<a href="http://www.doneinsixtyseconds.com/" target="_blank">doneinsixtyseconds.com</a>) is a video production company that puts the customer in control. The user gets to be the director, choosing actors, music, backgrounds, graphics, and more, while DISS handles the production. As it is completely automated, anyone can use DISS.</p>
<p>After the video is produced, there are many options for distribution. DISS can send it to ten of the top video sites online, or customers can order a full resolution version for television or trade shows. Since many of the videos are for websites, DISS provides the hosting so all the customer has to do is add the provided code to their site.</p>
<p>Kyle Lake, owner of DISS, is also a part of its parent company, Prosper Media Group, a full line production company. They saw a need for a tool to allow businesses to create short form videos at low cost with professional quality, so they could get information across to their audience in a better way than just text on a website. DISS is great for digital display advertising, like the FuelView videos they produced at Shell Gas Stations, and training videos.</p>
<p>DISS is currently working on the Great American Rivalry series, which previews top high school football games across the country. They also are working with the equestrian industry for website programming, upcoming events and features.</p>
<p>DISS uses a system that&rsquo;s hands off, so the website must be robust and have an easy to use format. One challenge they face is keeping the technology up to date. They want to have a variety of music, graphics and actors. They have an active talent pool with more than twenty actors, and are always looking for more talent.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge, however, has been getting the word out about their services. DISS is fairly new, with the beta version launching in 2008, so while their customers have loved their videos so far, they want more exposure. They are reachable by email at kyle@doneinsixtyseconds.com or phone by calling 888-328-8330.</p>
