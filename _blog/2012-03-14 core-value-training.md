<p>As a result of an invitation to discover what makes Awesome Inc awesome, I, a known outsider, found myself stepping into 348 E. Main Street on an unassuming Thursday evening. I tentatively made my way towards the low hum of voices past an open seating area, a dance floor, a conference room, a neon green coworking space and quickly found myself among friends. I could tell immediately by the atmosphere and the conversation that I was surrounded by people that were already friends and knew one another. However, I also felt &ldquo;among friends&rdquo; in the typical sense - everyone on Team Alpha started to introduce themselves and initiate me into the conversation so that I felt as if I was &ldquo;among friends&rdquo; although I had just met them moments before. It&rsquo;s easy to feel comfortable when the inviting smells of breakfast are wafting about as if you&rsquo;re having brunch with friends on the weekend. </p>

<p>While the evening started off with a social emphasis, once everyone&rsquo;s stomachs were full and the last of the pancake batter was being scraped from the bowl, it was time to get down to business. Although dubbed &ldquo;Being Awesome Pancake Dinner Club&rdquo; the true purpose of the meeting was to gather Team Alpha and share Awesome Inc&rsquo;s mission, goals and core values in a group setting. Email just isn&rsquo;t sufficient to share some messages.</p>
<p>The meeting came to order and I was struck by how well the gathering exemplified what I had already deduced of the true spirit of Awesome Inc. There was an eclectic mix of Team Alpha members huddled in a circle, which included a laptop and a screen, while seated on various leather couches, stools and chairs in a cozy, loudly painted room that houses the kitchenette, multiple seating areas and a ping-pong table. The meeting location symbolized the multi-functional organization that Awesome Inc has become, while the group demonstrated the potential for anyone and everyone to be involved. The juxtaposition of the technological components in such an informal, fun environment revealed the overall culture of the organization to me, while the bright wall colors represented the passion that is in the foundation of everything they do.</p>
<p>While many of my takeaways from the evening stemmed from my own observations, there were also many impactful statements spoken aloud. The mission statement, in layman&rsquo;s terms, is to create and grow creative and high tech companies. More specifically, the goal for 2012 is to start 20 companies that fall within that broad category of &ldquo;creative or high tech.&rdquo; While the definition of what&rsquo;s considered a &ldquo;company&rdquo; is still yet to be determined, there was no uncertainty when it came to the underlying strategy for achieving this objective.</p>
<p><img alt="core value training" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7044/6889669253_92d8f76950.jpg" width="300"/>The overall 20 companies will consist of ten Apprentices as well as an equal number of Fellowships. The Apprentices will be companies that may not provide high long-term growth potential, but will have a high velocity to the dollar. Awesome Inc will invest a small amount to assist in their start-up and will then partake in revenue sharing. On the other hand, the Fellowships will be companies that have high potential and high growth, but will take longer to ramp up. Support for these companies will come in the form of workspace, mentors, financial contributions, and the use of Awesome Labs among other offerings. In return the companies will provide Awesome Inc with equity in their company.</p>
<p>At this point in the meeting my mind is a little bit blown and I am very impressed by how the content has been presented as well as the content itself. The passion that the founders exude is almost tangible in the room and I find myself shifting towards the edge of myself and leaning forward as we circle the room and each person shares their reasons for getting involved with the organization. The remaining topic to be covered is the Core Values.</p>
<p>The seven previously established values were consolidated under four main pillars: Be Good, Be Excellent, Be a Friend and Be You. You can check out the <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/four-pillars-of-awesome" target="_blank">Four Pillars of Awesome blog</a> posting for a thorough explanation by an insider, but here&rsquo;s my &ldquo;outsider on the inside&rdquo; overview:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Be Good</strong>: Be honest to yourself and others and always have integrity. Good things will follow. If the product/service truly is for the good of the consumer than good things will come of it, more so than something created out of self-centered reasoning.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Be Excellent</strong>: As you follow the guidelines within the first pillar, you should find yourself at a good place doing something you love, and once you&rsquo;re there you shouldn&rsquo;t stop until you reach excellence in your execution.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Be a Friend</strong>: While doing what you love and doing it well is definitely awesome, there is nothing more awesome than people. Don&rsquo;t forget to collaborate and serve others in your quest for Awesomeness. The reward will be much larger than if you go it alone.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Be You</strong>: Lastly, if you find yourself within these core values then you&rsquo;re the type of person that Awesome Inc is built on and you shouldn&rsquo;t compromise who you are in order to reach your goals.</p>
<p>During the review of the core values the team was asked to participate and add their own examples and input. The leaders exemplified the values while examining them; that in itself fell within multiple pillars.</p>
<p>Overall, from all of my observations, visual and otherwise, it was evident that the founders and all of the members of Team Alpha do live by these values and truly believe in the mission.</p>
<p>During my personal mission to discover what makes Awesome Inc awesome, I realized it wasn&rsquo;t just those bright green walls that I loved at first sight, it is the culture that can only be created from people coming together to share their passions. The underlying mission of Awesome Inc is for each person to redefine the definition of awesome for themselves. I have no doubt that the team will come together to embody their values and live their mission statement.</p>
