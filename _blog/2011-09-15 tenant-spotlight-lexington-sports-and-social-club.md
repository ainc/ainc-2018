<p>Adults over 21in the Lexington area looking to participate in casual recreational sports leagues and socialize with fellow patrons now have a chance to do so thanks to the Lexington Sports and Social Club.</p>
<p>Karl Beisel, founder of the Lexington Sports and Social Club, got his vision for the locally based club up and running in the fall of 2010. Since then, the Lexington Sports and Social Club has averaged around 300 athletes per season.</p>
<p>The sports rotate based on the season. League seasons are eight weeks long; include a preseason party at a local sponsoring bar and a single elimination playoff for qualifying teams.</p>
<p>After games, which are once a week, players have the option to socialize at a bar close to the game. The given bar for that particular week sponsors an event for league members after their games.</p>
<p>“The bars sponsor us,” Beisel said. “They (the bars) are located near the fields (which vary based on sport.) We look at a few different options and talk to the owners about getting us discounts and specials,” …“It’s different from other leagues because it’s not just a team, it’s about the whole league – you get to know people from the whole league, we all go to the same bar. In traditional leagues, it’s about the competition and interacting purely with your own team. We’re focused on getting everybody together.”</p>
<p>Hybrid athletes can join but competition isn’t purely what the club is based upon.</p>
<p>“We draw a lot from nontraditional athletes; the sports are an excuse to socialize,” … “There are some existing clubs a like but we focus more on adult socializing,” Beisel said.</p>
<p>Users participate in a league by creating an account on the website, <a href="http://www.lexssc.com/" target="_blank">http://www.lexssc.com/</a>, and picking which sport(s) they want to participate in for the season. Each league is $49. </p>
<p>Users then have the option of creating their own team and inviting people to play, requesting to join a team or being placed on a team based on need. There are also teams that consist of all newly joined members.  Every team is co-ed and has a minimum/maximum for each gender.</p>
<p>Sports being offered this fall are kickball, flag football and dodge ball.</p>
<p>The deadline for flag football is Sept. 19; the deadline for dodge ball is Oct. 4. The deadline for kickball has passed but people interested can still join after paying a $10 late registration fee. </p>
