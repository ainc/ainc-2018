<p><a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.commercelexington.com/" target="_blank">Commerce Lexington</a>, hosted <a href="http://lexington.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">Startup Weekend Lexington</a> on Nov 22 - 24, 2013 in downtown Lexington. Over 50 people participated in the event, as part of seven teams:</p>

</li>

</li>
</ol><p><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with <a href="http://startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a> events, the general format is as follows: “Anyone is welcome to pitch their startup idea and receive feedback from their peers. Teams organically form around the top ideas (as determined by popular vote) and then it’s a 54 hour frenzy of business model creation, coding, designing, and market validation. The weekends culminate with presentations in front of local entrepreneurial leaders with another opportunity for critical feedback.” The top two teams from this year’s Startup Weekend Lexington were The Recovery Station and Deckvex. However, all teams that participated in the Startup Weekend event during <a href="http://www.gew.co/" target="_blank">Global Entrepreneurship Week</a> are eligible to compete in the <a href="http://www.globalstartupbattle.co/" target="_blank">Global Startup Battle</a>, sponsored by Google. </p>

<p>There was a third standout team that had their own personal record setting accomplishment. Awesome Jerky generated over $5,000 in revenue over the 54 hour period of Startup Weekend, which is a record for the Lexington event. </p>
