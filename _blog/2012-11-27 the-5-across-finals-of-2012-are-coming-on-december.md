<p>The Lexington Venture Club and Awesome Inc. will announce the finals for their &ldquo;5 Across&rdquo; business concept pitch competition next week.</p>
<p>Five Across, an event sponsored by the Bluegrass Business Development Partnership, is an informal gathering of entrepreneurs, investors, and service providers from the Bluegrass Region.</p>
<p>Beginning at 5pm on the 5th of December, 5 teams each are given 5 Minutes to pitch their concepts.</p>
<p>There have been five rounds this year featuring presentations from entrepreneurs who have pitched their ideas to a panel of judges (and audiences who also vote.) Each winning team has won $500.</p>
<p>The winner of the final round will take home a $4,000 cash award with the runner-up receiving $1,000.</p>
<p>The final event is scheduled for 5:00pm â€“ 6:30 pm at Awesome Inc., 348 East Main Street in Lexington, KY.</p>
<p><strong>The finalists:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wade Powell and Geoff Carlson</strong> of Cornerstone Innovations will pitch the company&rsquo;s disposable cup lids for cold drinks promoted to specialty markets such as long-distance running events. The high-flow disposable cup lid allows runners to consume water or sports drinks quickly without slowing down, choking, or spilling the liquid all over themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Lippert</strong> of Last Call Ventures will present Faveo, a beverage for hangover pre-treatment. This beverage, when taken during alcohol consumption, will scavenge the toxins produced from alcohol metabolism, reducing hangover symptoms or even preventing them altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Jordan, Sam Bake and Kyle Vaughn</strong> will be pitching their company&rsquo;s online platform, Rate My Rental, which allows students to easily access information concerning area housing by viewing property listings around their college campus alongside reviews of previous tenants.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Sullivan</strong> will pitch the business model for his company, Alliance Virtual Offices. Sullivan&rsquo;s concept combines three central components necessary to service mobile and work-from-home professionals: People, Place and Technology.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Adams</strong> will be pitching <a href="http://www.earthineer.com/" target="_blank">Earthineer</a> and the company&rsquo;s network designed exclusively for homesteading and sustainable living which allows people to socialize, find experts, and trade commodities.</p>
