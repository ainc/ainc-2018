<p>As fate would have it, I&rsquo;ve found myself without quality air conditioning on a day when such an amenity is quite necessary. Gazing around the <a href="http://www.commongroundsoflexington.com/" target="_blank">coffee house</a> currently sheltering me from heat-induced migraines and an endless battle with perspiration, I&rsquo;ve become quite fascinated with each of the faces illuminated by laptop screens and smart phones. Essentially the entire customer base is bridged to the outside world by a technological medium, and each of us is vigorously using our respective bridge for some unique (or <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">not s</a><a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">o unique</a>) purpose. While some may consider this accessibility a plague to humanity, those of us that cradle our electronic devices like newborn children have learned to appreciate the possibilities presented by the rapid advancements in technology seen throughout recent years. In order to keep the innovation flowing, it&rsquo;s imperative that brilliant, new ideas be nurtured and given the opportunity to flourish. Last week, the<a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc.</a> team traveled to Boulder, Colorado to learn more about an organization that is doing just that.</p>
<p>From the TechStars <a href="http://www.techstars.org/" target="_blank">website</a>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;TechStars is a mentorship-driven seed stage investment fund. Each year we run a summer-long program in Boulder, Colorado and Cambridge, Massachusetts. We&rsquo;re very selective - each year hundreds of companies apply to the program and we only take about ten per city. These companies get up to $18,000 in seed funding, a summer of intensive top-notch mentorship, and the chance to pitch to angel investors and venture capitalists at the end of the summer&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>In summary, TechStars accepts twenty companies out of roughly five-hundred applicants and provides those companies with </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_money" target="_blank">seed funding</a> and mentorship during a three-month summer bootcamp. After an intensive preparation, each company pitches its idea to investors and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital" target="_blank">venture capitalists</a> in an attempt to raise the funding necessary to make its aspirations a reality. In past years, the organization has aided projects like<a href="http://intensedebate.com/" target="_blank">IntenseDebate</a>, <a href="http://socialthing.com/" target="_blank">Socialthing!</a>, <a href="http://brightkite.com/" target="_blank">Brightkite</a>, and <a href="http://www.dailyburn.com/" target="_blank">Gyminee</a> obtain the knowledge and resources necessary to take their projects to the level that they are at today. We had the pleasure of sitting through this year&rsquo;s pitch day to see some of the up-and-coming projects designed to take the world by storm. Here is the list of companies that presented. <a href="http://www.reteltechnologies.com/" target="_blank"><br/>ReTel Technologies</a> helps stores and restaurants optimize their operations and customer experiece. ReTel&rsquo;s system analyzes in-store security camera feeds to uncover, analyze, and report on metrics and trends that directly impact the bottom line. <a href="http://www.everlater.com/" target="_blank"><br/>Everlater</a> makes it simple to document and remember travel experiences in a beautiful format. We enable easy sharing with family and friends by connecting to all major social networks and printing scrapbooks, postcards, and photo albums. Finally, we connect people with better travel ideas and information through exploring friends travel experiences. <a href="http://www.timzon.com/" target="_blank"><br/>TimZon</a> is the easiest way to share visual feedback. By combining audio, video, whiteboard and screen capture it enables companies to establish high quality engagement with their customers while lowering support costs. <a href="http://www.takepublishing.com/" target="_blank"><br/>Take Comics</a> is an end to end solution aiming to bring comics into the digital age just like iTunes has done for music and video. Take Comics creates pixel perfect content on a range of devices with focus on profitability for the publishers and readability for the users. <a href="http://thenextbigsound.com/" target="_blank"><br/>Next Big Sound</a> measures the growth and popularity of bands across the major web properties and sells actionable insights around tat data to band managers and industry professionals. <a href="http://www.vanillaforums.com/" target="_blank"><br/>Vanilla</a> is open source forum software that is used to power discussions on more than 300,000 sites across the web today. With the releases of the new and improved Vanilla 2, we will now be offering a hosted solution as well. <a href="http://www.sendgrid.com/" target="_blank"><br/>Send Grid</a> is an email service that solves the problems faced by companies sending transactonal outbound email. Simply by using Send Grid instead of their current outbound email servers, companies experience greatly improved deliverability and scaliability while cutting costs and saving time. <a href="http://www.spryplanner.com/" target="_blank"><br/>Spry</a> is insight into software projects. By monitoring all the tools and services used to develop software and analyzing the data in real-time, Spry enables clear and consistent communication throughout the team. This helps managers and developers make better decisions throughout the process thereby reducing the likelihood of failure and delay. <a href="http://www.mailana.com/" target="_blank"><br/>Mailana</a> brings your real social network to life - the people you communicate with on a regular basis. By understanding your strong relationships across multiple communication channels, Mailana lets you share what realy matters with the people who really matter. <a href="http://www.rezora.com/" target="_blank"><br/>Rezora</a> is the only Software-as-a-Service email marketing platform specifically designed for the real estate industry. We enable brokerages and their agents to focus their expertise on what they do best: helping their consumers buy and sell real estate. Out of those ideas presented, my favorites were <a href="http://thenextbigsound.com/" target="_blank">Next Big Sound</a>, <a href="http://www.takecomics.com/" target="_blank">Take Comics</a>, <a href="http://www.spryplanner.com/" target="_blank">Spry</a>, and <a href="http://www.reteltechnologies.com/" target="_blank">ReTel</a>, but I find each of the ten to be highly useful to its targeted audience. I hope to see each of these projects thrive within the next few years and pave the way for future innovations. Keep doing what you&rsquo;re doing, TechStars! The world needs <a href="http://ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">more organizations like you</a>! Stay tuned for the second part of the recap detailing everything that I learned from this experience and Boulder, in general!</p>
