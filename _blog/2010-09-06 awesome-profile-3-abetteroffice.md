<p>aBetterOffice (<a href="http://www.abetteroffice.com/" target="_blank">abetteroffice.com</a>) helps people find flexible, turnkey office space throughout the U.S. With 1700 listings in major and midsize metropolitan areas, daily original articles about the industry, and phone consultations, they help small businesses, entrepreneurs, and satellite offices of large corporations find the perfect office.</p>
<p>Owner Mike Sullivan originally worked for a large company in the office space industry. There was a lack of analysis and news coverage of office space and he saw an opportunity to start a business to address those areas. aBetterOffice is now a premiere sources of information thanks to the daily articles they post.</p>
<p>Sullivan&rsquo;s goal is to build a portfolio of services around flexible work spaces to serve the small business market. The office space he markets is similar to Awesome Inc. in that there is the flexibility to just walk in and have a meeting and to rent for years or just a month. However, it is more traditional with set workspaces and secretaries. So far the biggest challenge has been getting more involvement and engagement from the industry.</p>
