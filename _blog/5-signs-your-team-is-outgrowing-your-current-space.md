Your team and business is growing, which means you’re trying to adapt and accommodate. We don’t know everything (we were today years old when we learned fish can yawn), but we do know a thing or two about why companies and teams choose our coworking space and we figured we’d share some of those reasons.

Creating and sustaining a successful business means addressing problems and forecasting ones that may arise. The area you work in has a huge effect on the quality of your work so making sure you are recognizing the problems that arise in that space can make a drastic difference. If you’re starting to feel a little crammed in your current space, take a look at these signs below that may mean it’s time to move into a larger office.


<ol>
<li> Privacy? What’s That?</li>
<p>
If there’s no shot of you getting a second to work in privacy, you might want to consider the possibility of getting a larger work space. A good work atmosphere means having areas for collaboration and areas that are more heads down. This balance allows for peak productivity and happier employees. Think about the times you’ve been focused on a task just to be interrupted. Now think about this happening consistently at work. Not only is that unmotivating but when that happens frequently, it will have a visible result on efficiency.

<li>The Conference Room is Constantly in Use</li>
<p>
It shouldn’t be a privilege to use the in office conference room! If your conference room is starting to feel more like its own office or there’s a rare chance of you getting to use it for a meeting, you have a problem. It’s frustrating when you need to schedule out a private area for a meeting but can’t seem to find a place or time to do it. This is the case with many work areas and it causes a decrease in efficiency and an unnecessary burden to everyone.
</p>


<li>Lack of equipment</li>
<p>
Your office should be set up to make your work easier. This means having the right equipment. Otherwise, you might as well be working from home. Having up to date computers, necessary office supplies, and enough square feet are all important for a workforce to be at peak performance.
</p>


<li>Noise Pollution</li>
<p>
Any workplace will have its fair share of conversations, but if you have an adequate amount of space, you should be able to avoid this noise if necessary. Otherwise, productivity is bound to plummet.
</p>


<li>Overflowing Cabinets</li>
<p>
Have you ever walked into a cluttered room and immediately felt overwhelmed? A lack of space can make you feel like this in your office every day. This can have real repercussions. A study by the National Association of Professional Organisers found that cluttered workspaces can lead to a company’s financial loss equivalent to 10% of a manager’s salary. If this resonates with you, it may be time to start searching for a larger office.
