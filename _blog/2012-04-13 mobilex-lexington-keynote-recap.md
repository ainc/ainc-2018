<p>MobileX is off to a great start! The morning kicked off with keynote <a href="http://www.seanshadmand.com/" target="_blank">Sean Shadmand</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/sshadmand" target="_blank">@sshadmand</a>) of<a href="http://www.getsocialize.com/" target="_blank">Socialize</a>. The topic of his presentation was &ldquo;The Loop: How You&rsquo;re Losing Customers&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Shadmand entered into the entrepreneurial/ start up world when he moved to San Francisco and started working at <a href="http://www.tagged.com/" target="_blank">Tagged</a>, a social network site. He then created <a href="http://www.familyoven.com/" target="_blank">familyoven</a> to share recipes. When he moved back to Washington, D.C. in 2008, mobile was taking off. Shadmand said, &ldquo;People thought mobile was a fad. A pet rock is a fad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 2010, Shadmand had created a DIY mobile product, <a href="http://www.appmakr.com/" target="_blank">AppMakr</a>. By 2011, he had added a social component to it with Socialize. Through all of this, Shadmand became very familiar with the life cycle of apps. According to Shadmand, usership drops off to 5-10% of users 90 days after an app debuts. To fix this, Shadmand recommends to quit complaining and shape your own mobile revolution.</p>
<p>To do this, Shadmand introduced the concept of The Loop. The Loop is a concept of circular mobile marketing. First the user posts something to an app and their friends see it and comment. The comments bring the original user back to the app and they post something else, which starts the circle again. The way to use The Loop to your advantage is to let your users promote your services freely to their social network.</p>
<p>The key is to keep re-engaging the user. There are those who are hesitant to &ldquo;bother&rdquo; a user by allowing them to promote the app with their friends. However, users are not accidentally browsing to your app, they are choosing to download it and want to be a part of your community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more bored that I realize,&rdquo; Shadmand says of browsing on his devices like a cell phone. His advice is to take advantage of this and give users something to distract themselves with.</p>
