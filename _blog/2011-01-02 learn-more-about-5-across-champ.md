<p>Anthony Schmidt won the champions edition of 5 Across with his company <a href="http://apoonline.org/" target="_blank">APOonline</a>. APOonline is a chapter management system specifically for the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity, a coed service fraternity. They offer event calendars, mass emailing, records keeping, reporting functionality, budgeting, attendance tracking and more. Services are available to chapters, sections, regions, petitioning groups, and alumni associations. There is also the APOonline Community, a social networking site open to all APO brothers.</p>

<p>After creating a system for just APO, Schmidt created <a href="http://greektrack.com/" target="_blank">GreekTrack.com</a>, which is for any Greek or non Greek organization. It has all the features of APOonline, but it is customizable to each organization. Organizations can fill out their information on the website and within the week they&rsquo;ll have a website that can be used externally for recruiting and internally for organization. It is different from other companies offering this service because it focuses on national level organization; GreekTrack.com provides the administration with live data and statistics on individual chapters or groups.Schmidt created APOonline when he was president of his APO chapter of over 140 members at UK. His goal was to streamline meetings and promote larger membership so that they could provide more service to the community. APOonline has since spread to over fifty other chapters and sections.</p>
