<p id="docs-internal-guid-1559c522-fbef-6620-4ac9-9ba8840c6ba4"><a href="http://tagapet.com" target="_blank">TagaPet</a>, the Kentucky based startup that brought NFC technology to the pet industry, is on the move! Founded by Michael Ward (CEO), Mac Glidewell (COO), and Ben Wilson (CTO) TagaPet offers electronic tags for pet owners to help locate their pets in the event of them getting lost. These tags utilize NFC, or Near Field Communication technology, which allows the tags to be scanned by placing them near a NFC capable smartphone. QR codes are also printed on the tags so they can be scanned by phones lacking NFC.</p>
<p>After winning the Kentucky Idea State U Elevator Pitch Competition in 2012, completing Awesome Inc’s Accelerator program the following summer and launching their product in early 2013, TagaPet is now in Amsterdam for Startupbootcamp’s new accelerator program, <a href="http://www.startupbootcamp.org/programs/nfc-contactless.html" target="_blank">Near Field Communications &amp; Contactless Interactions</a>. TagaPet is one of ten companies selected to participate in this new accelerator designed around contactless interaction technology, and the only team selected from the United States. During the three month program, TagaPet and their peers will have access to over 500 mentors from around the globe, free coworking office space in the new Vodafone HQ and access to test labs, legal and fiscal advice, marketing support and a plethora of other services to help improve their products. At the conclusion of the program, the ten teams will pitch their products/startups to investors in Amsterdam. Awesome Inc is proud of the accomplishments TagaPet has made and we they learn a lot during this venture.</p>
<p>TagaPet is also running an <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tagapet-using-technology-to-protect-your-pet" target="_blank">Indiegogo campaign</a>. If you wish to support the TagaPet team and product, pledge your support for them <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tagapet-using-technology-to-protect-your-pet" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>

<p>&ldquo;It (StartupBootCamp in Amsterdam) has been an experience of a life time. We would not be here without you guys! Awesome Inc brought us here and we really appreciate it.</p>
<p>By appreciate, I mean thanks for making my life a roller coaster day in and day out. Most depressing and rewarding life ever.” -Michael Ward, 11/2/13 - about one month into their accelerator program in Amsterdam</p>
