<p>Premiere Dance (<a href="http://www.premieredancelex.com/" target="_blank">premieredancelex.com</a>) provides a creative outlet for people who want to express themselves through movement or learn a new art form while having fun in a laid back atmosphere. They have classes in tap, jazz, ballet, modern, hip hop, and lyrical as well as social dances such as Swing, Foxtrot, Waltz, Salsa, Tango, and Rumba. With classes for children as young as 3 through adult, there is something for everyone.</p>

<p>Premiere Dance currently serves about 30 students, with class sizes ranging from 3 to 10 students, as well as private lessons. The dance classes are based on age and not experience level, so the instruction is challenging enough for students with experience, but not too challenging for beginners.</p>
<p>Fields had wanted run her own dance studio since she was young, but retail space in Lexington was too expensive. There was space for the studio in Awesome Inc., so she decided to take the opportunity to pursue her dream. Although she minored in business, she found that business plans are just a guide and you can never plan for all situations, but have to figure it out as you go.Owner and instructor Rebecca Fields has years of dance experience. She started dancing when she was 3 years old, attended SCAPA for 7 years, minored in dance at UK, and coaches a church dance group. She found there were no dance classes in Lexington for adults with full time jobs who just want to have a fun, social experience one night a week, so she started Premiere Dance.</p>
