<p>Tony Ho first came to Awesome Inc in early 2011. His educational background was in chemical engineering, but he joined Team Alpha as a web developer. He quickly took over managing the Awesome Inc, Kentucky Entrepreneurial Hall of Fame, and 5 Across websites. Every time a task was assigned to him, he quickly responded with a &ldquo;Done!&rdquo;, thus earning him the nickname &lsquo;Done&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Tony caught the entrepreneurial bug at Awesome Inc, and he moved to San Francisco to launch his own startup, <a href="http://greatphotorace.com/" target="_blank">GreatPhotoRace</a>. He also is the front end engineer for another startup in San Francisco, Rentcycle. While there, he has hosted Lexington startup entrepreneurs and was a volunteer coordinator for Vator Spark.</p>
<p>Awesome Inc has recruited over 100 awesome interns like Tony in the last three years. They are hosting a workshop, &ldquo;How to Recruit Awesome Interns&rdquo;, to share their knowledge. The first portion of the workshop will be an informative presentation on how to find, select, and retain all-star interns for your team. The second portion of the workshop will be a hands-on workshop to start recruiting team players before you walk out the door.</p>

<p><strong>Time:</strong> 8:30 AM to 10:45 AM</p>
