<p>This weekend, Awesome Inc is hosting Lexington&rsquo;s third annual Startup Weekend and we couldn&rsquo;t be more excited. We&rsquo;re gathering the highly motivated group of developers, business managers, startup enthusiasts, marketing gurus, graphic artists and more that we work with on a daily basis for one common goal: to build businesses.</p>
<p>A full three days are spent networking, learning how to launch a business and actually launching a business. It is an amazing opportunity to connect with other passionate and skilled individuals. Three days may not seem like a long enough time to turn your ideas into a reality. And maybe it&rsquo;s not, but that&rsquo;s the point. The whole purpose of the three days is to keep you from just talking about their ideas; we want you to actually do something about them. Instead of brainstorming about your business, create it.</p>
<p>Startup Weekend 2010 will be held November 19-21st at Awesome Inc. The event will be a part of <a href="http://www.gewusa.org/" target="_blank">Global Entrepreneurship Week</a>. More information can be found at: <a href="http://lexington.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">lexington.startupweekend.org</a></p>
