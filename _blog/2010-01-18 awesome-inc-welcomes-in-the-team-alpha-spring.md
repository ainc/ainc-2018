<p>We don&rsquo;t have interns at Awesome Inc. We have Team Alpha - a well oiled machine that knocks out to-do lists quicker than Muhammad Ali can knock out Sonny Liston. They tackle assignments better than Ray Lewis tackled opponents in his prime. They throw down projects with more authority than Lebron James. Unafraid of any task, from building sound proof rooms, to fixing ping pong tables, to dominating Google sketch-up, Team Alpha can and will do anything to make Awesome Inc more awesome. This semester&rsquo;s class is highly rated among startups nationwide. Allow me to introduce the Team Alpha Spring Class of 2010.</p>
<p>Leading the way is Therese Henrickson. Therese is in her 2nd term and is the captain of team alpha. Some people say they&rsquo;ll take talent over experience any day. I say, give me both. Therese is an all star and will be responsible for three primary initiatives: 1. Managing the team 2. Awesome Space administration 3. Event Coordination</p>
<p>Ashley Williams is our other returning team alpha member. Ashley was our utility player last semester and will be taking on a similar role this semester with a focus on: 1. Awesome Space administration 2. Online and Offline purchasing</p>
<p>Coming in from the <a href="http://comm.uky.edu/?page=Internship+Program" target="_blank">University of Kentucky Department of Communication</a> is Bert Berry and Zach Magoto. Investors beware: this dynamic duo doesn&rsquo;t take no for an answer. Bert plans to focus his semester on the following: 1. Organizing the creation of the Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame 2. Marketing Events Meanwhile, Zach will be dominating these projects: 1. The creation of Awesome Media, the new media outlet for Awesome Inc 2. Awesome Space administration</p>
<p>Another University of Kentucky undergrad, Garrett Ebel, comes in standing 6'2&quot; and weighing 175lbs. He was recruited to Team Alpha through <a href="http://lexington.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">Startup Weekend 09</a>. Garrett likes to play soccer, work with his hands, and enjoys long walks through the Awesome Space while listening to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMt8ZYaJKmA" target="_blank">#3</a>. Garrett has one goal for the start of his career at Awesome Inc victory over the garage and its team of junk, filth, and disorder.</p>
<p>Two team members come from local high schools through a program called <a href="http://www.fcps.net/about-fcps/education-options/careertech/ebce" target="_blank">EBCE</a>. EBCE stands for Every Body Can Execute and so that&rsquo;s exactly what this crew does! Actually it stands for Experience Based Career Education but all that matters is that Matt Storrs and Desny Guerrier follow rule #22 &ldquo;go big or don&rsquo;t be my friend&rdquo;. Matt is spending his time on: 1. Entrepreneur Profile Wall showcasing our rockstars including the likes of Steve Jobs (<a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="blank">Apple</a>), Larry Page and Sergey Brin (<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="blank">Google</a>), and Jack Welch (<a href="http://www.ge.com/" target="blank">GE</a>). 2. Graphics Design Desny has a niche focus on the arts and will be solely dedicated to making Awesome Inc more awesome looking by painting our logo all over the place and designing a giant mural for the art studio.</p>
<p>Our ace in the hole this semester is David McGee. David tweets like his life depends on it. Our online reputation lies in the hands of this young social media expert. His primary focus will be Awesome Inc&rsquo;s online presence, more specifically: 1. Online Social Media for Awesome Inc&rsquo;s twitter, facebook, etc 2. Website Content 3. Building Community</p>
<p>No team is complete without a video highlights reel. That is where Walker Miller, Henry Clay High School senior, comes into play. Walker can simultaneously record a shoot, mix a soundtrack, and render transitions, all while making himself a sandwich. Walker&rsquo;s primary focus this semester is to develop Awesome Inc&rsquo;s video presence into something that Paramount Pictures will be begging to acquire within the calendar year.</p>
<p>Rounding up team alpha are three big names, two more from the University of Kentucky, Hilary Perrine, recent grad and Josh Strange, computer science genius and one from East Jessamine High, Madeline Knoblett. Hilary, Josh, and Madeline are focusing on the <a href="http://www.mobilexconference.com/" target="_blank">mobileX conference</a> series and assisting with marketing, planning, and website development. They don&rsquo;t let the fact that no one has ever pulled off five mobile conferences in a two month span in various cities throughout the Midwest before even phase them. They just execute. Period.</p>
<p>We have a don&rsquo;t ask, don&rsquo;t tell policy at Awesome Inc, don&rsquo;t ask for extensions and don&rsquo;t tell me any excuses. Its business 101, keep a low FF (flakey factor) and a low SS (crap to substance ratio). It all goes back to rules<a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org/rules" target='_blank"'>#21</a> and <a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org/rules" target='_blank"'>#76</a>. So if you&rsquo;re part of team alpha, that means you&rsquo;re launching a series of conferences, building a media conglomerate, inventing a hall of fame, or doing something else equally as Awesome. If you have the guts to follow <a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org/rules" target='_blank"'>rule #22</a> and are interested in being part of the team, we&rsquo;re accepting applications at:<a href="http://awesomeinc.org/information/team-alpha/" target="_blank">http://awesomeinc.org/information/team-alpha/</a> Special shout outs to last semester&rsquo;s team alpha for creating the environment and culture that promotes excellence - Eric Prince, Chase Bullock, Sarah Frank, and Simeon Kondev.</p>
