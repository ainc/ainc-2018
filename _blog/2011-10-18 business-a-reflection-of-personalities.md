<p>Your business is a reflection of your personality – your strengths, weaknesses, quirks, and preferences. This sounds a bit esoteric, at least it did the first time I heard it, but the more I look at businesses the more I realize how true this is. It&rsquo;s true in a young small company and even in a large company. Heck, even Microsoft and Apple seem to be outward expressions of their founder&rsquo;s personalities.</p>
<p>When you walk into Awesome Inc., especially a year or so ago it screams &ldquo;Brian and Luke!&rdquo;. There are just a bunch of enthusiastic young people doing things they like. There are several things going on at once that cover different areas of interest – from comics to touchscreens to ballet. This is how my brain works&hellip;and so this is the environment that we&rsquo;ve created. The space has recently become much more clean and organized - something important to Therese, our Team Alpha captain and main employee - so guess what? It&rsquo;s much organized than it would be if only my personality were being reflected.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s important to note that not only does a business get it&rsquo;s personality from the founders, it also inherits the founders weaknesses if they are not extremely proactive about getting people on their team to compensate for those weaknesses.</p>
<p>Again, look at Microsoft &amp; Apple. Bill Gates was not particularly visually creative. I doubt he spent much if any time studying calligraphy&hellip;he was too busy coding. Steve Jobs, on the other hand (who didn&rsquo;t know how to code by the way), dropped in on calligraphy classes after dropping out of college. Bill Gate&rsquo;s dominance of the software market is indicative of his in depth understanding of it and his business acumen for it. Steve Job&rsquo;s appreciation for design and visual beauty are what have made Apple and its products the standard in industrial design in their fields. Actually those calligraphy classes he dropped in on ended up coming in handy when it was time to determine the spacing between letters on the modern home computer. It ended up being the standard on all personal computers.</p>
<p>But Gates/Microsoft is still trying to catch up with Steve/Apple in &lsquo;coolness&rsquo; and aesthetic design while Apple is doing its best (and finally starting to gain significant traction) an actually owning a nontrivial size of the software market.</p>
<p>So realize that your personality&hellip;including your weaknesses&hellip;will come out in your business if you don&rsquo;t have a human being there to fill in with that as a strength. There is no piece of software or system that will make up for your own behavioral flaws so either fix them before you start, pay someone to take care of these types of tasks for you, or bring on a cofounder whose strengths complement your weaknesses.</p>
