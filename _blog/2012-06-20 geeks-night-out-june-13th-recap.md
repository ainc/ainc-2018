<p>As an avid fan of all things beer-related, I was ecstatic to learn about the concept of Geek&rsquo;s Night Out, a common event sponsored by IN2LEX/Commerce Lexington. This time around, the venue of the meeting of some of Lexington&rsquo;s best and brightest (the geeks!) was at the new West Sixth Brewery, a craft brewery located on Lexington&rsquo;s north side.</p>
<p>Upon arriving, I was immediately welcomed by the people at the Commerce Lexington desk who informed me I would be receiving a free beer (I chose the amazing double IPA) and pretzel, making the event that much more valuable for me to attend as a poor college student. I immediately noticed the large crowd as I tried to find a seat, eventually settling for a picnic table on the patio, enjoying surprisingly pleasant weather for June in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Seeing old friends and making new connections with the constant rotation of beer-guzzling entrepreneurs and tech junkies who made their rotations throughout West Sixth, Geek&rsquo;s Night Out was a great opportunity, overall, to get out of the workspace and socialize. It&rsquo;s important to take a break from the daily work grind and Geek&rsquo;s Night Out was an excellent opportunity to do so. I fully recommend that everyone come out to the next one! Awesome Inc will surely be there in full force, once again, to take advantage of the free brews and tasty food. Many thanks to IN2LEX, Commerce Lexington and the wonderful West Sixth Brewery for hosting us!</p>
