The 5 pitches were given by Food Four Good, Cloverleaf, Coupon Out Loud, Pre-Visit, and Credit Fair-E. Food Four Good pitched the idea of providing vending machine around the city of Lexington so low-income families can have fresh and affordable meals. The vending machines will be refrigerated allowing Food Four Good to keep perishable items in them as well as non-perishable foods.</p><p> Cloverleaf pitched their idea of a website used to target your strengths in order to build teams. This tool is perfect for becoming more in touch with what youâ€™re good at and then finding a team and environment that best suits you. Cloverleaf also allows business to find the right person for a position within that business. </p><p>Coupon Out Loud aims to make using coupons a breeze with a mobile app that saves you time and money with coupon selection. The app will pick up what store you are in and automatically pull coupons for that particular store. You no longer have to spend hours cutting out coupons and organizing them. Coupon Out Loud does all the hard work for you.</p><p>Pre-Visit is a mobile app created by by a doctor in order to make doctor visits quick and easy. The app allows you to tell your story by documenting symptoms in your own words creating more face-to-face interaction with your doctor at your visit. Credit Fair-E is a company that provides loans at an affordable rate which means less stress for those needing loans.</p><p>All of the pitches for the evening were great, but the winner of the $500 prize money was Pre-Visit! Cloverleaf was the crowd vote winner which was determined by an app used during the event. Thanks to all the teams who participated! Join us for the next 5 Across event in October.</p>
