I’ve been running the Awesome Inc podcast since January 2019. It’s been an enjoyable way to build relationships while growing my audio production abilities. I have a background as a musician, but since I’m not recording guitar parts or traveling, running a podcast has been my creative outlet. 

Here are a handful of takeaways from the last two (going on three) years:

**1. Know your WHY.**

* Yes, I said it... I guarantee as a podcast host, editor, or consumer, you will enjoy and receive more value from a show that knows its mission.

**2. Bring out the best in people.**

* The world tends to be negative. People often hear more negative than positive. Be intentional with your encouragement.

**3. Create a framework for your process.**

* At Awesome Inc, we call these playbooks.
* Document all steps:

  1. find guests
  2. connect
  3. set a recording time
  4. prep for your recording
  5. record the episode
  6. edit
  7. revise
  8. distribute
  9. promote the episode
  10. follow-up with guest(s)

**4. Be human! A podcast is a conversation; don’t be robotic.**

* The first handful of episodes I was a robot. I’d ask a question, listen to a great response, and follow-up with the next question. I wasn’t connecting. 
* Don’t worry about small details like having the perfect email to connect with someone - it doesn’t exist.

**5. If it takes less than two minutes, automate it.**

* I automate a lot of email templates, copy and paste outlines, and create steps that add value even when they're reused.
