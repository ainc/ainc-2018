<p>The winner decided by the judges was Randy Lynn of &ldquo;Starborn Solutions&rdquo;. Congratulations Randy! You did a great job, even despite a small technical hiccup with the projector.

<p>All the pitches were great! We&rsquo;re sure the judges had a hard time making their decision. Thanks to everyone who came out in support of this event. We were happy to see you and hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. See you all next time!</p>
