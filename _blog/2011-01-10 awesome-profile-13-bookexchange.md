<p>BookExchange (<a href="http://bookexchange.com/" target="_blank">bookexchange.com</a>) is an online textbook market that connects local students buying and selling college textbooks. Their goal is to provide a less expensive alternative for students to buy textbooks. BookExchange currently serves UK, UofL, NKU, EKU, WKU, University of Cincinnati, Murray State University, Bellarmine University, Georgetown College, University of South Carolina, and Texas Tech University, but they hope to expand to more than fifty schools.</p>
<p>BookExchange was started in 2004 by Brian Raney, Nathan Fort, Luke Murray, Justin Raney, and Matt Smith. They had the same problem every college student has, paying too much for textbooks and not getting enough in return, so they created BookExchange to solve that problem for all students.</p>
<p>One of their challenges has been monetizing the site since they don&rsquo;t charge users and don&rsquo;t generate enough traffic yet for ads. Also, their customer changes every four years. They consider their biggest accomplishment to be pitching their idea to Facebook and being immediately rejected.</p>
