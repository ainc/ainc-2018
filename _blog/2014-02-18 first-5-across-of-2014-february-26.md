<p>2014’s first edition of 5 Across comes to Awesome Inc featuring some of the most innovative pitches yet. The idea is simple: five entrepreneurs present their idea for five minutes in front of judges and an audience for a chance to win $500. Winners from all the events will advance to the finals and compete for prize money totaling $5,000 later this year. 5 Across brings together entrepreneurs, investors, and the community in an informal setting with the aim of inspiring a new round of creative thinking. Come join us at 5pm on February 26<sup>th </sup>and get inspired for $5 (there’ll be food too).</p>
