<p>Last Saturday Awesome Labs had their first official event in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.ckic.org/" target="_blank">Central Kentucky Inventors Council</a> and<a href="http://www.newtonsattic.com/" target="_blank"> Newton&rsquo;s Attic</a> called &ldquo;Invention Saturday&rdquo;. The idea was to build a <a href="http://www.break.com/index/best_rube_goldberg_ever.html" target="_blank">Rube Goldberg machine</a> in a single day, and it had its genesis from the concept of <a href="http://www.break.com/index/best_rube_goldberg_ever.html" target="_blank"><span>Startup</span> Weekend</a>, where a group of people get together and start a business in the course of a weekend. A little over a dozen people showed up on Saturday morning, ranging in age from 18 to 80 and after a breakfast of <span>Dunkin</span> Donuts, we got to work coming up with what the machine would do and the overly complex series of steps necessary to get it to accomplish this task. Eight hours later we were able to open a door and after six or seven crazy steps, turn on a light bulb. I learned a lot about physics and mechanical engineering that day but I also learned three important things about making ideas into a reality - whether it&rsquo;s a business, a Rube Goldberg machine, or a ground vehicle aerodynamic-enhancing truck modification (another current Awesome Labs project).</p>

<p>When it&rsquo;s low cost &amp; low risk, pull the trigger before you&rsquo;re &ldquo;ready&rdquo;. Brandon, one of the UK engineering students that participated in I.S. found some steel cage material and a ball and had the idea of putting in a 3-dimensional &lsquo;kerplunk&rsquo; type apparatus similar to The Price Is Right game show. With those 2 objects he decided that was what he would build, and so he just started building. If he would have waited and planned out exactly all the materials he needed, he never would have finished it by the end of the day, because the way it had to interface with all the other things around it had not been determined yet (what would be directly before it? what would follow?). He had to continually adapt to what he was doing in order to make it fit everything around him. The same is true of any idea. Start working on it now and be ready to change the peripheral details about how you get it done&hellip;because those are always in flux.</p>

<p>Getting simple things done consistently is hard. Christopher and Andrew, two other UK students had a very simple idea: have a cylinder swing and knock a hammer backwards, and then have that hammer knock a ball over as it swung forwards again. Seems really easy, but getting this right took A LOT of tinkering, and if it didn&rsquo;t work it killed the whole machine right away&hellip;as it was one of the first steps. The lesson here is don&rsquo;t procrastinate on the 'simple&rsquo; parts of your idea because you think they&rsquo;ll be easy and take no time. Odds are it will end up being much more difficult than you think. Old people + Young people = Awesome people. There is a lot of talk about how important diversity is and for the most part I disagree with it because when it&rsquo;s implemented, it is usually diversity for diversity&rsquo;s sake. However, when everyone is excited about working towards a common goal together, having a range of ages and experiences really comes out in how well things get done and the opportunity for teaching that goes on. Bill <span>Cloyd</span>, owner of<a href="http://www.newtonsattic.com/" target="_blank"> Newton&rsquo;s Attic</a> (a company that offers interesting educational experiences&hellip;like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY0KQvMKvV4" target="_blank">this one</a>) was able to offer help and ideas to some of the engineering students there and the students were really glad to be surrounded by professional engineers, inventors, physicists, etc. The give and take was very apparent&hellip;not only in the moral but in the results.</p>

<p>So, in eight hours we pulled it off and made something really easy into something really complicated&hellip;but we also managed to learn the importance of an itchy trigger finger, the complexity of simplicity, and the importance of team diversity when trying to do something Awesome!</p>
