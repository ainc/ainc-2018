<p><strong>Jim Wombles</strong> is presenting Game Face, which will be a mobile smartphone app that makes it fun for users to connect, share, and play together at sporting events. Game Face provides sports fans with a way to interact in an online environment in a way that enhances the sports game they are watching or attending in the real world, providing them with a richer experience. Users will be able to check-in their location wherever they are so their friends can find them at the game, represented on a map overlay of the stadium and parking lot. When they check-in, a miniature version of their Facebook profile photo will be placed at their location, along with a bubbling blob of blue (for a Kentucky fan), around that image announcing their allegiance. Users will also have the ability to create their tailgate location (for football games), upload a picture of their tailgate crew, and share their location with friends on Facebook, making it easy for their friends to find them and also download the app.</p>
<p><strong>John Pospisil</strong> will be pitching Gallifrey Systems Incorporated, which is developing a variable output portable oxygen device that increases safety for those patients prescribed home oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Rogers</strong> will be pitching Hidden Level Games, which is a &ldquo;Kingdoms of Eternity&rdquo; virtual trading card game. This is a modern version of the classic trading card game. The company will sell virtual cards and advertising space.</p>
