<p>Choosing a job is a big decision.  Probably, the only place you spend more time than your job is your bed.  </p>
<p>I get to work with a lot of college students who are about to graduate.  Some of them are interns at <a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org" target="_blank">Awesome Inc</a> or <a href="http://www.apaxsoftware.com" target="_blank">APAX Software</a>.  Others are students in various program at the University of Kentucky where I serve as the Entrepreneur In Residence.  One common issue facing all these students is “how do I find the right job upon graduation?” (<a href="http://ctt.ec/F1Q1H" title="click to tweet" target="_blank">Click to Tweet</a>)</p>

<p>My advice lies in the answers to these two questions:</p>
<p>1. Will you enjoy it&hellip;a lot?</p>
<p>2. Can you be successful at it?</p>
<p><strong>Can you enjoy it?</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to realize that this question isn't “Can you tolerate it?”  This question trumps the 2nd question.  If you aren't happy, it will be much more difficult for you to be successful.  And even if you can find success in an unhappy career, it’s not fulfilling.  </p>
<p>The most important component to finding happiness in your job is the people around you.  Working with great people can allow for any task to be fun.  I’ll always remember the first year we opened up Awesome Inc and would host events on the weekends to make ends meet.  The events were often parties that would end with our space being a complete wreck.  My business partners and I would find ourselves cleaning chewing gum off the floor with a kitchen knife and a cube of ice at 2am.  This doesn't sound like fun, but it was actually a great time.  And it was only fun because I was doing it with fun, positive people.  </p>
<p>In addition to working with great people, you have to believe in the mission of your work and believe that your work (the specific role that you are playing) matters.  Assisting in the completion of your company’s mission is often far removed from the completion of your individual tasks so it’s critical that you can see the connection.</p>
<p>Jon Acuff, author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Start-Punch-Escape-Average-Matters/dp/1937077594" target="_blank">Start</a>, gives a great example of this. He small talks an Apple customer service rep during a typical call and asks the rep if she enjoys her job.  He expects to get an answer like, “It’s ok.  It pays the bills and in today’s economy, I’m just lucky to have a job.”  This is about the most positive answer that I’d expect from the service rep as well.  I mean, think about it.  They listen to people complain all day about their problems with the latest Apple devices.  No one ever calls just to say, “Hi, I was just calling to let you know that I’m really happy with my new iPhone. Tell your company nice job. Have a great day!”</p>
<p>However, the service rep surprised him with this answer instead, “I love my job.  I enjoy doing two things - helping people solve problems, and learning new things.  I get to do that all day long.”</p>
<p>This rep understood 1. what made her happy - helping people &amp; learning things and 2. how her job fit into the greater purpose of Apple - ensuring that people who bought these great products got the most out of them.</p>
<p><strong>Can you be successful at it?</strong></p>
<p>This one is a little trickier and takes time.  Ironically, this one is also very dependent upon on how much you enjoy your work and the people around you.  </p>
<p>The best way I've learned to predict whether I will be successful at something is to compare myself to people that have already been successful at the same thing.  Ask yourself questions like, “Do I possess the same skills as these people?”, “Do I have a similar background?”, “Do my values line up with these people?”, “Are my personality traits similar to these people?”, “Do I like the same things as these people?”</p>

<p>Another thing to remember is that you have to put in reps to be successful.  It doesn't happen overnight.  It takes time.  </p>

<p>Here are a few litmus test type questions you can ask yourself about your current or future job that might be indicative as to whether not you have the “right” job?</p>
<ol><li>How much do you look forward to Friday over Monday?  It’s ok if you look forward to Friday, but if you absolutely dread Monday and start looking forward to the weekend before noon on Tuesday, you might not be that happy at your job.</li>
<li>Are the people around you just “average” at what they do or are they “exceptional”, at least in some ways?</li>
<li>When you check your watch and it says 4:55pm, are you super excited that you get to go home or are you a little disappointed because you wanted to get more done that day?</li>
<li>Do you actually like your co-workers? Would you hang out with them outside of work?  Would you go on a road trip with them?</li>
<li>Are your supervisors pushing you to be a better overall person (not just focused on making you better at serving at the company, but really investing in your professional and personal development)?</li>
