description: Drawing entrepreneurial lines through one of the world's most beloved romcoms.
---
For the first time in the summer of 2022, I watched Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan fall in love on the streets of New York City in *When Harry Met Sally*. It was the best romcom I’d ever seen, and it still holds that top spot for me today (yes, it’s better than *10 Things I Hate About You*). As I often do after watching a well-written film, I was scrolling through an article of quotes from the movie and started to piece together a hidden picture of the entrepreneurial journey buried within the script. 

If you think entrepreneurship and the classic romantic comedy *When Harry Met Sally* have nothing in common, think again. Beneath the surface of witty banter and heartfelt confessions lies a treasure trove of lessons for aspiring entrepreneurs. From love at first sight to the pursuit of happiness, I’ve curated a collection of quotes from the movie and compared them to the exhilarating journey of starting a business. Let's explore the parallels between the two worlds!

***"You look like a normal person, but actually, you are the angel of death."*** - Sally

In entrepreneurship, appearances can be deceiving. Your idea may seem ordinary at first glance, but it could hold the potential to disrupt entire industries or change people's lives. Embrace the fact that the most innovative concepts often hide behind unassuming facades. Believe in your vision and trust that your business idea can be a game-changer.

“When I buy a new book, I read the last page first. That way, in case I die before I finish, I know how it ends.” - Harry

Starting a business is an unpredictable journey, and the outcome will not be clear from the beginning. However, just like Harry's peculiar reading habit, conducting thorough research before launching your venture is vital. Understanding the market, identifying potential obstacles, and foreseeing challenges can help you make informed decisions and increase the likelihood of a successful outcome.

***"No man can be friends with a woman he finds attractive."*** - Harry

In the entrepreneurial realm, passion and commitment are essential. If you have an idea that excites you, don't settle for just being "friends" with it. Dive headfirst into exploring its potential, nurturing it, and giving it the chance to blossom into a full-fledged business. Passion and attraction to your idea can drive you through the tough times and keep you motivated when challenges arise.

***"Waiter, there is too much pepper on my paprikash."*** - Harry

In the startup world, it's easy to become overwhelmed with a multitude of opportunities, ideas, and tasks. Like Harry complaining about the excessive pepper, sometimes, you need to say "no" to certain distractions and stay focused on your core idea. Avoid spreading yourself too thin or chasing too many opportunities simultaneously. Concentrate your efforts on refining and perfecting your business concept before venturing into new territories. If life does get too busy and overwhelming, don’t be afraid to take a rest from the chaos.

***"Harry, I can't do this anymore. I am not your consolation prize. Goodbye."*** - Sally

Never settle for mediocrity in entrepreneurship. Don't treat your business idea as a "consolation prize," half-heartedly pursuing it while dreaming of something better. Commitment to your idea and unwavering belief in its potential are essential. If you find yourself unsure or unenthusiastic, take the time to reassess your goals and passions, and be ready to let go of an idea that doesn't align with your vision or the current market.

***"Why can't we get past this? I mean, are we gonna carry this thing around forever?"*** - Harry

Entrepreneurs often face obstacles and challenges that can feel burdensome, hindering progress and creativity. Just like Harry's emotional baggage, holding onto these issues indefinitely can impede your business's growth. Confront challenges head-on, find solutions, and be willing to adapt. Don't let setbacks define your entrepreneurial journey; instead, learn from them and keep moving forward.

***"When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."*** - Harry

Entrepreneurs often have a eureka moment when they discover an idea with boundless potential. When you stumble upon that unicorn idea, don't hesitate—take immediate action. Launching your business as soon as possible gives you a head start in the market and allows you to refine and improve your offering based on real-world feedback. This is advice I could take myself; I often delay my ideas until I can’t stop thinking about them, which can take weeks, months or even years.

*When Harry Met Sally* is more than just a classic romantic comedy—it holds valuable lessons for aspiring entrepreneurs. From embracing the unexpected to staying committed and passionate, this timeless movie serves as a source of inspiration for anyone embarking on the journey of starting a business. So, like Harry and Sally finding love in unexpected places, take a leap of faith, believe in your idea, and let your entrepreneurial journey begin with excitement and dedication. Remember, the path to success may be full of twists and turns, but with perseverance and a touch of movie magic, you just might find your happily ever after in the world of entrepreneurship.
