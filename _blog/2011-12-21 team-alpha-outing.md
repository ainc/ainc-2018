<p>For the third consecutive year, Awesome Inc. employees and interns ventured outside of their comfort zone as they went on a team building trip to the outskirts of Lexington on a fall Sunday night.</p>
<p>The night was highlighted by a canoeing race as the staff was divided into two teams. Prior to the canoeing endeavor, flash light headbands were dispersed amongst the teams because trying to see without one, given the physical circumstances, would be like wondering through a maze blindfolded.</p>
<p>Each team had one practice run at trying to get into the canoe and figure out the best way to work with each other. To say that an overall sense of puzzlement clouded over the two teams, due to the fact that canoeing was a new concept to about half of all members, would be delicately put. But when it comes to survival, its sink or swim and even though meeting the bone chilling water face first in the near pitch black conditions only seemed inevitable, the two teams each worked together to develop on-the-fly strategies and member roles to ensure success despite the fact that failure was looming.</p>
<p>The successful night was capped off with conversation and sâ€™mores around a camp fire.</p>
