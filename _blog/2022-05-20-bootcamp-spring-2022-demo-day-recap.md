By Nick Such

Last week, a new cohort completed our latest Web Developer Bootcamp (our 12th!), and we are excited for you to see how far these allstars have come.

We're always impressed by the backgrounds of our learners before bootcamp, and this group doesn't disappoint. They've worked in law enforcement, motorsports, food service, and customer service. They've helped run small businesses, or even have started their own. And now they know how to turn ideas into plans, plans into code, and code into software soluions for real-world problems.

Our Demo Days have looked different over the past couple of years, but this event continued a recent trend, with more than 80 in-person attendees. For those who weren't able to attend, we want to share a recap of the event, so let's dive into these student demos.

## The Demo List

Eight students, now developers, presented at Demo Day. Hereâ€™s the crew:
