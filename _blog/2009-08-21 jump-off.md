<p>Launching a brand is just like taking a leap of faith. No matter how much time you spend talking about how great it is going to be and the benefits for every one in the world, the brand still has to launch. I attend a church locally where my lead pastor has said we are in the year of the jump, meaning our church is going to grow fast with a new building addition.  So a friend of mine (NateFX) and I followed that lead and coined the term jump off for launching a brand with a tag line of might as well jump (set to the Van Hallen song of the same name). </p>
<p><br/>Nate and I came up with that on a phone call at about 10 pm in the middle of March and are now launching our first brand together.  Through launching this brand we are actually launching a new business idea.  This means there is beta testing and all the rest. It is a real fun time and a great time of anticipation for the success of this brand and business. <br/><br/>Take a look at this video page and see what a brand is doing with nothing but volunteers on the team and a paid person leading the charge.  Anything can be done if you take a leap of faith&hellip;. might as well jump. :-) <br/><br/><a href="http://www.vimeo.com/qpza" target="_blank">http://www.vimeo.com/qpza</a> <br/><br/><a href="http://www.vimeo.com/qcc" target="_blank">http://www.vimeo.com/qcc</a></p>
