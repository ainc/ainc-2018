<p><em>It was another great year for the 5 Across pitch competitions, with presentations reaching a new level of quality in 2013. The Bluegrass Development Business Partnership was pleased to be the lead financial sponsor of this program which is a great asset for the entrepreneurial community. Below is a blog written by this year’s finals winner: PowerTech Energy.</em></p>

<p><br/>First of all, I wanted to thank everyone at Awesome Inc for their guidance throughout the process of developing a business pitch. I come from the world of science and research, so while I may give research talks on multiple occasions throughout the year, a business pitch is a completely different animal, so thank you!<br/><br/>PowerTech Energy is a compilation of research engineers including me, James Landon, and other research scientists including Cameron Lippert and Kunlei Liu. Our purpose is to develop more efficient technology towards power generation that meet and exceed the environmental needs of the current generation and those of the future. I think to some, power generation can be a somewhat boring topic, but when you think about the things you do everyday — charging your phones and laptops, turning on your lights, and putting gas in your car — you may realize just how incredible some of this stuff really is and how much we may take it for granted. As the world population continues to grow, the importance of clean power generation with minimal impact to the environment will be even more important.<br/><br/>The technology we’re working on right now is a highly efficient water treatment device that can easily remove salt molecules from water. The first market we are targeting is the water used in our many research laboratories across the country. These laboratories rely upon ultraclean water to run consistent, reliable experiments. Current water treatment devices are expensive, inefficient, and require constant maintenance. The solution to this issue is the development of a device that treats water in a new manner. As the business grows, we see opportunities for this water treatment device in a variety of new markets including wastewater treatment and personal water consumption. The average person can use up to 100 gallons of water per day, not a small sum, so we see the possibility of increased growth with the development of these new markets.<br/><br/>The money won through the 5 Across competition will go a long way towards our business growth. We have already used some of the money in a provisional patent filing for part of the technology and will continue to pursue intellectual property protection. We will also continue to develop critical business and manufacturing contacts in the community and will use some of the money to develop a website showcasing some of the technology for possible business partners. Finally, over the next few months, a larger-scale prototype will be constructed that will be capable of meeting the laboratory water treatment market discussed earlier. As a small business, every little bit of money helps a tremendous amount. The business contacts we gained through this competition have already proven to be invaluable as well. Thanks again to everyone at Awesome Inc, and we look forward to the new year and new opportunities ahead!<br/><br/><em>By: James Landon</em></p>
