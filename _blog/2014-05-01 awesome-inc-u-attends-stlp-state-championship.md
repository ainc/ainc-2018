<p>On Tuesday, April 22, the Awesome Inc U team decided to flashback to their high school days and make an appearance at STLP’s State Championship at Rupp Arena. STLP (Student Technology Leadership Program) is a Kentucky program that teaches kids of all ages the operation and creation of technology through a series of project-based competitions. Essentially, it’s a club available to kids from elementary school to high school where they can get together, make cool tech stuff, meet like-minded peers, and get recognized for the cool stuff they do (you can learn more about STLP <a href="http://stlp.education.ky.gov/" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

<p>The genuine interest and enthusiasm shown by the STLP kids was remarkable. We came with the goal to promote Awesome Inc U and expose as many kids as possible to basic coding principles. We were blown away by the response of students at the conference. Students were incredibly intelligent and were picking up on coding principles at a pace that would have made Mark Zuckerberg proud.  It was refreshing to see so many kids with a genuine passion in learning how to code. What started as a computer and a few iPads soon turned into a jumble of laptops, tablets, and other devices pulled from the pockets of the Awesome Inc crew in an attempt to satisfy the unceasing tide of kids waiting to code their own Angry Bird game. (If you’ve never tried the Angry Bird learn to code game, check it out<a href="http://learn.code.org/hoc/1" target="_blank"> here</a>.) The overwhelming sentiment of the day was that there is a huge number of young kids with a desire to learn how to create their own stuff using computer programming. Unfortunately this demand is not being met in many schools across the state and country.</p>

<p>The good news is that there are many outside opportunities and venues for kids to learn how to code. For starters, Awesome Inc U is offering a Week of Code program this summer from July 8th to 11th. It’s similar to a summer camp, except a lot cooler &ndash; students will create their own website, mobile app, and video game, all the while acquiring skills in a plethora of programming languages (additional information can be found on the <a href="http://www.awesomeincu.com/curriculum/#k12-week" target="_blank">Awesome Inc U website</a>). Awesome Inc U also offers Hour of Code classes for local schools and a wide variety of one-day programming courses. Information on both of these can also be found on the previous link.</p>
<p>The enormous amount of interest by Kentucky’s youth is evidence that the Commonwealth has a huge pool of young, talented, and interested minds ready to jump on any opportunity they get to learn more about coding. Programs like STLP are great because they provide kids an outlet to pursue their passions. Awesome Inc U works to further their opportunities by teaching kids tangible programming skills that can be utilized for the rest of their lives to accomplish their goals and dreams. Both of these programs are great, but it is up to the community as a whole to support these kids in their endeavors and cultivate an environment where any kid with the desire to learn has the opportunity to do so.</p>
