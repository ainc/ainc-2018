<p>April’s edition of 5 Across brought together a good mix of social entrepreneurs and tech businesses. It was another standing room only event with plenty of first timers.<b><br/></b></p><p>Serandu Custom Boots were first to pitch. They presented 3D scanned custom riding boots. <a href="http://www.nectargamestudios.com/" target="_blank">Nectar Game Studios</a> followed up with their episodic RPGs. The nerdy part of me was highly intrigued. </p><p>Adrienne from <a href="http://www.kumariarts.net/" target="_blank">Kumari Arts</a> switched up the vibe and pitched her social initiative which empowers women in poverty. Kumari Arts partners with craftswomen from rural areas around the world for their products. Impact Box kept the social entrepreneurship going with a subscription service for fair-trade items. Last but not least, was <a href="http://rachelsavestheworld.com/" target="_blank">Rachel Saves the World</a>’s home energy auditing. Rachel vowed to save the world from inefficient homes and high energy prices. </p><p>The judges had a tough time determining the winner for this event but had to come to a conclusion. Ultimately, Kumari Arts left with $500 and a ticket to the 5 Across Finals in December. Congratulations to Adrienne and her team!</p><p>Keep a look out for the next 5 Across on June 29. See you there!</p><p><br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="683" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/debb339fdd1f46852b4e6221b05d8af9/tumblr_inline_o6eztwU9Mp1spm8pc_540.jpg" data-orig-height="683" data-orig-width="1024"/></figure>
