<p>WHAT:</p>
<p>After several successful MobileX events, Awesome Inc is pleased to host the sixth MobileX conference in Lexington. MobileX is a one-day conference where attendees will engage with a multitude of prominent presenters, examine mobile solutions and learn technical concepts in mobile and related industries. Current and potential entrepreneurs, investors, developers, industry professionals and other mobile followers are invited to attend.</p>
<p>MobileX will begin after breakfast with an opening keynote presentation followed by multi-track sessions. A few examples of the specific breakout sessions are: Android beginners, mobile marketing, social media and advanced technical tracks.</p>
<p>One of the most compelling parts of MobileX is the start up pitch contest. This is an exceptional chance for contestants to concisely advocate any start-up idea or business they may have created related to the mobile sector.</p>
<p>Competitors are allotted five minutes to pitch their idea to a panel of judges. Afterwards, a three-minute session of Q&amp;A is held with the judges and if time allows, with the audience. Those competing are allowed to use slides or present a demo, but it is not deemed necessary. The judging panel will offer feedback and then the audience will vote via their mobile devices. A combination of judges and audience vote will determine the winner.</p>
<p>The winner will receive a 500 USD prize in PayPal cash. The competition is beneficial to all whom compete because of the constructive feedback and networking opportunities available through the experts convened at MobileX.</p>
<p>WHY:</p>
<p>The mobile market is skyrocketing at momentous speed. Demand for smart devices such as the Android, iPhone and Blackberry reflect a thriving market. Developers have collectively been able to cash in on this new software delivery platform to the tune of several billion dollars in sales. At the last Apple keynote event on March 2, Steve Jobs announced a payout of two billion dollars to developers for apps sold through the iTunes app store. RIM Blackberry and Google Android devices are used by millions, as well, providing competition and an innovative pace mobile users are enjoying.</p>
<p>MobileX seeks to present information that will enhance overall understanding of the mobile industry. The conference will thoroughly aid in this endeavor by exploring the changes within the mobile industry itself. MobileX will also address the industries that the changes may affect directly.</p>
