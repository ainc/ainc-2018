We’re determined to celebrate startups no matter what, so we’ve made the decision to move 5 Across June out a month to July 29th (mark your calendars!) In the meantime, we have another way to get involved. \*Drumroll plz\*



We’re putting on a 5A5K during the month of June!!



Here are all the things you’ll accomplish by running, walking, or crawling this (remote) 5K:



* You’ll support startups (!!)
* * We’ll be using [Moolathon](http://moolathon.com/)’s social fundraising fitness platform that helps organizations raise funds! You’ll be an early adopter of their (easy-to-use) app and help them grow! [Download it here for iPhone.](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moolathon/id1486017163) (Sorry Android users, your time hasn’t come yet.)



* All proceeds will go toward [Feed The Frontlines](https://www.ftflkentucky.org/), a non-profit that buys food from local restaurants and then feeds frontline healthcare workers. Support local business \*and\* local heroes - two birds, one stone.



* If none of that convinces you, we’ll be offering prizes to the leaders of the fastest time, most money raised, and if you’re really an overachiever, the most miles run on top of the required 3.1 miles.



It’s $10 to register and you have until June 30th to move your body 3.1 miles any way you can, anywhere you’d like!



Got any questions? Check out our FAQ!



FAQ's:



When is it?

* Any time between June 1st and June 30th at 11:59 pm.

Where is it?

* Anywhere! Download the Moolathon App and then run, walk, or crawl 3.1 miles in your neighborhood, the nearest college campus, or in circles in your parent's basement.

How do I sign up?

1.Download the [Moolathon App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/moolathon/id1486017163)

How do I raise money?

* In order to raise money, you will need to get people to donate to your personal campaign! You will either need to share your campaign link with them and they can donate as a guest, or they can download the app and search your name to find your campaign.



What should I do when I'm done?

* Snap a sweaty selfie and tag [@moolathon](http://moolathon.com/), [@awesomeinclex](https://www.awesomeinc.org/) and#5A5K

What if I don't like supporting startups or front line workers?
