<p><strong>Linkset, <em>Wayne Yeager</em></strong></p>
<p>Linkset aims to succeed where so many others have failed: identify new content on the Internet for users to interact with based on their bookmarked links. Linkset seeks to bridge the gap between the user and what a user desires with an opportunity to monetize that gap while directing new content to be discovered. Wayne brings a wealth of experience to the company including founding several dot coms and is an “emerging entrepreneur” in the Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame. </p>
<p><strong>Nimex Technologies, <em>Nathan A. Wright</em></strong></p>
<p>This venture seeks to improve fuel dispensing in portable containers and prevent overfilling. Nathan is currently a senior at the University of Kentucky studying mechanical engineering. He hopes he can eventually use his technical expertise to stimulate economic diversity in his home, Eastern Kentucky. </p>
<p><strong>CompleteSet, <em>Gary Darna, Jaime Rump</em></strong></p>
<p>CompleteSet connects collectors with other collectors and, more importantly, new sources to add to their collection. It vets traditional sources collectors look such as Amazon and eBay, but also scours message boards and other collector reviewed archives. CompleteSet is co-headed by Gary Darna, who is an avid Star Wars collector and holds a degree in Entrepreneurship, as well as Jamie Rupp who is studying computer science and was accepted into Northern Kentucky University’s inaugural business accelerator class: iNKUbator. </p>
<p><strong>Xproctor, <em>Salah Shakir</em></strong></p>
<p>Xproctor delivers an innovative way to maintain the integrity of in-class studies online. By verifying user identity, Xproctor hopes to eradicate academic dishonesty in distance education. Dr. Shakir has over 26 years of experience working with higher education in the United States and abroad, as well as with Fortune 500 companies in automating and integrating critical facets. </p>
<p><strong>Wrap Me LLC, <em>Sonja Gregory</em></strong></p>
<p>Wrap Me brings a holistic attitude to wellness starting not with only your life, but also with those around you. By using fully natural products and a unique body wrap, Wrap Me aims to relax the mind, restore the spirit, all while beautifying the skin. Sonja founded a non-profit in 2008 aimed at promoting health and wellness among children. Realizing it required a more comprehensive effort, she founded Wrap Me LLC providing not only education, but also service to foster healthy living.</p>
