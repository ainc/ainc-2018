<p>By: Jake Tapia</p><p>Your favorite pitch competition, 5 Across, is coming up in two weeks. It looks like we’re in store for another barn burner at Awesome Inc. Just like usual, the winner will take home a $500 prize and punch a ticket to the 5 Across Finals in December to compete for the grand prize of $5000. Here’s a quick preview of the teams.<br/></p><p><a href="http://usa-economics.com" target="_blank">USA Economics</a> offers “financial planning for the 99%” through various apps and web platforms. It was founded by three Asbury University professors Paul Hamilton, Mark Gill, and George Allen with PhDs Economics, MIS, and Marketing, respectively. These guys definitely know what they’re talking about when it comes to money.</p><p>

<a href="http://www.communitydigitaladvertising.com/" target="_blank">Community Digital Advertising</a> displays 10 second ads on a display screens across Woodford County.  Founder Patrick Coffman has over 20 years of experience in marketing and sales. Why are they awesome? Well, they recently received credit from the Woodford County Sheriff for an arrest of a wanted person after they displayed the wanted posters on their system.

</p><p>The <a href="http://mommypouch.com" target="_blank">Mommy Pouch</a> is a product designed to fit on the side of car seats. It can be used to hold all sorts of items like baby toys and various motherly swag. The founders are Adam, Kara, and Baylor Mays, possibly one of the youngest founders ever in a 5 Across.</p><p><a href="http://miitab.com" target="_blank">Mii Tab</a> provides a biometric payment system for amusement parks, clubs, and other fun places with long lines. Their aim is to reduce wait time in long lines while also providing a convenient method of payment. Founders Jeffery Jett and Andrew Rodgers have extensive experience in sales and software engineering, respectively. </p><p><a href="http://travelnotes.io" target="_blank">Travel Notes</a> makes traveling more convenient by notifying financial institutions their cardholder’s travel plans when the cardholder purchases airline tickets. Through the collaboration of the airline and the bank, Travel Notes also streamlines the reimbursements from the airline to the bank in the case of an overbooked or delayed flight. This two pronged approach is from the minds of Hudson Chilton and Jonathan Pickard.</p><p>Which company will walk out with the money bags next Wednesday? You’ll have to be there to find out!
