<p>For the second year in a row, our team at Awesome Inc has the honor of working with a group of German <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright_Program" target="_blank">Fulbright scholars</a>. These students are spending a month at the University of Kentucky and the focus of their studies is on entrepreneurship. Working with the <a href="http://gatton.uky.edu/vace/" target="_blank">Von Allmen Center at UK</a>, we have been leading the Fulbrighters through a four-week, hands-on journey into startupland, and we’re pretty excited to hear their teams pitch on Wednesday. Through programs like <a href="http://www.5across.org/" target="_blank">5 Across</a>, the <a href="https://ci.uky.edu/inet/page/uk-venture-challenge-rules-guidelines" target="_blank">UK iNET Venture Challenge</a>, <a href="http://fellowship.awesomeinc.org/" target="_blank">Awesome Fellowship</a>, and starting our own series of companies, our team at Awesome Inc has been part of the idea-to-reality process with over 100 startups. If you’ve participated in a <a href="http://lexington.startupweekend.org" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a> before, then you’ve probably been through a similar process. But for the rest of you with a lingering idea or some vague desire to start your own company, I want to share our process for the early days of becoming an entrepreneur.</p>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>While you may think that you have the one great idea for your startup, I’d disagree. What you have is one potential idea that is part of a set of many possible solutions for a given opportunity. Let’s say the problem you want to solve is a basic one: people who work in offices near yours get hungry around lunchtime. One solution that may quickly strike you is to open a restaurant nearby. Great idea! While this is indeed an appropriate solution, you may be overlooking a more viable solution. Perhaps it’s a hassle for nearby workers to leave their office buildings to go to a restaurant, so a delivery service or caterer would be more effective. It’s important to avoid falling in love with your initial idea because it’s likely to change.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/edit?id=1YnfnIC6WXU2dOOaroFULjlm-IK4X2C0Ev6A_VaAJSxg" target="_blank">brainstorming phase</a>, it’s important to first clearly identify the problem, then to generate a variety of possible solutions. When coming up with these solutions, here are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming" target="_blank">four brainstorming tactics</a>: focus on quantity, withhold criticism, welcome unusual ideas, and combine and improve ideas. That’s right, brainstorming is not about finding the best solution right away. It’s about admitting that sitting in a room alone with your team is not a sufficient way to identify the best solution. Instead, you want to create a list of many possible solutions, one of which may lead you to your best solution. You will then test these ideas in later phases of the startup process.</p>
<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>Our team at Awesome Inc includes some vocal critics of written Business Plans. These static documents are what <a href="http://steveblank.com/2012/02/16/who-dares-wins-the-2nd-annual-international-business-model-competition/" target="_blank">Steve Blank calls</a> acts of “creative writing.” However, we are huge fans of the process of business planning. When doing this, there are a few tools we use. The first is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas" target="_blank">Business Model Canvas</a>. Sometimes categorized as a one-page business plan, the Canvas is a diagram that helps businesses quickly and visually understand a few key components of their business. The emphasis with the Canvas is on simplicity, iteration, and pivot points. I find that one of the most effective ways to use the Canvas is diagramming the business models of your competitors. What are they good at? Where do they struggle, leaving you with an opportunity to innovate and compete?</p>
<p>It’s also hard to argue with the value of a <a href="http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2012/03/financial-planning-for-saas-startups.html" target="_blank">classic financial planning spreadsheet</a>. In order to have a business that survives, you somehow have to earn more than you spend. One way to whittle down your list of brainstormed ideas is to remove ideas that will never make (enough) money to survive. While financial projections, like all attempts at predicting the future, are estimates at best, it’s important to weed out any ideas that don’t look as exciting in a spreadsheet as they sounded in your head.</p>
<h2>Prototyping</h2>
<p>Once you’ve identified a viable idea, it’s time to build it. But don’t you rush off and drop $10k on cutting injection molds just yet! We’re in the prototype phase, which means you want to quickly build a minimally expensive, minimally feature-laden version of your product. You will throw away this prototype when you’re done, but you’ll get to keep the learning that it brings you. The prototype is valuable because it allows your customers to experience your product. More importantly, it allows your team to observe your customers while they experience your product. Do they hold it the way you expected them to? What pieces do they think are missing? What features do they ignore?</p>
<p>Sometimes called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" target="_blank">Minimum Viable Product</a> (MVP), prototypes can vary widely from your intended final product. The <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27532820/original_screencast.html" target="_blank">prototype for Dropbox’s</a> cloud storage service was a video showing founder Drew Houston synchronizing files across multiple computers and devices. There are disputes as to whether the Dropbox service he demonstrated was fully functional at the time, but that’s irrelevant. Dropbox’s eventual customers were able to experience the product through that video, so it was a viable prototype. And as a result of watching the video, they handed over e-mail addresses in droves to be part of Dropbox’s early beta release. Which brings us to our next step&hellip;</p>
<h2>Validating</h2>
<p>In the end, the only reason that a business will fail is that its founders decide to give up. Just prior to that end, however, the common struggle that leads those founders to close shop is lack of customers. In the brainstorming phase, you should have what we call “uninformed optimism”. All your ideas look golden and wonderful when they are but crisp words on a page. The planning process, with a Business Model Canvas and spreadsheet, will help remove the obvious non-starters. But what for the rest, the ideas that look like they might work? The only way to find out is to ask the people who hold the power to decide to give you their money: your customers.</p>
<p>The process of Customer Development begins with <a href="http://steveblank.com/2014/06/28/customer-discovery-the-search-for-productmarket-fit-2-minutes-to-see-why/" target="_blank">Customer Discovery</a>. Who are your potential customers? You may think you know who they are, but do you truly understand their problem? The importance of this understanding, this empathy, is often underestimated by entrepreneurs. Until you’re certain of what your customers want, you’ll waste time and money trying to build the wrong product. At this point you should form a hypothesis, an educated guess as to how your customers will react to your product. Your mission now is to prove your hypothesis wrong. This may sound counterintuitive, but in a business (as in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method" target="_blank">scientific experiment</a>), you’re in this for the long run, so you’re seeking a verifiable truth. So if, in spite of your best attempts, you can’t prove your hypothesis wrong, then perhaps you’ve found a viable business opportunity. It’s important to not lie to yourself at this stage. People will fill out surveys telling you that they love your product. Your mom will always be a big fan of things you create. But when your customers actually transact something with you, be that spending money for a pre-order, or even submitting email address to join your mailing list, then you have some real evidence of customer demand.</p>

<p>The process we describe here is an iterative approach, cycling through these four steps until you get closer to building a product that truly meets your customers needs, at a price they’re willing to pay, provided at a cost at which you can afford to keep running your business. While we favor this process, there are certainly <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html" target="_blank">variations</a> that work just as well. In particular, many entrepreneurs start from different places, having done some Ideation and Customer Discovery as a seamless part of prior life experiences or occupations. Whatever process you select, I recommend that a) you have some process, and b) you heed these <a href="http://steveblank.com/2010/04/08/no-plan-survives-first-contact-with-customers-%E2%80%93-business-plans-versus-business-models/" target="_blank">words of wisdom from Steve Blank</a>: “No plan survives first contact with customers.” Finally, remember that this idea stage is about 1% of your total startup journey, the rest is execution. Happy startuping!</p>
