<p>When you start out in business, it might be a long time, as in several years, until you make any dime of revenue, let alone a significant enough profit to support yourself. However, you need to know the &lsquo;heart&rsquo; of your business well enough to recognise when it&rsquo;s beating. Otherwise, you can easily get discouraged and conclude that the work you&rsquo;re doing isn&rsquo;t 'working&rsquo; and that it never will.</p>
<p>At Awesome Inc there are times when I&rsquo;ll be working in our space and notice that the 'heart&rsquo; is beating. I&rsquo;ll look up and see almost all the desks are filled with entrepreneurs working on their companies. There&rsquo;s a dance lesson going on up front, a meetup of comic book artists in the conference room, and <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/teamalpha" target="_blank">Team Alpha</a> plugging away in the break room. There will be a photo shoot going on in the film studio and a couple engineers working in the garage on a touch screen. It&rsquo;s happening. The heart is beating.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that none of this is really making us enough money to do anything with other than hopefully cover the rent. So why do I know that the heart of my business is beating? Better yet, how can you know that the heart of your business is beating? Here are two simple questions that are tough to answer, but once you have answered them, they will make it so obvious when it&rsquo;s happening it will be as if the walls were pulsing.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you exist?</strong></p>
<p>My company exists &ldquo;to start and grow high tech, creative, and entrepreneurial companies and communities&hellip;in fun, cool ways&rdquo;. This is the first thing you see on our website and is the first thing I say when someone asks me what my company does. So when I look around and see that touch screens are being made (high tech company), cartoon artists are collaborating (creative community), a dance class is going on (creative company), and Team Alpha is planning a Hack Fusion event (high tech community) we are fulfilling our purpose.</p>
<p>Again, notice that there&rsquo;s nothing in here about making money. Rarely is someone&rsquo;s desire to make money the core reason their company exists, especially if the business is actually successful. Most people I know that start a business just to make money don&rsquo;t succeed, so if that is why you think you exist, I would encourage you to look at why you started your business again. It&rsquo;s okay to want to be financially successful, but you have to have a reason more important than another zero in your bank balance. In my case, the main motivation I have for making money is so that I can fulfill the Awesome Inc mission above in even more impactful ways (i.e. creating a fund for startups, opening up another incubator in another city, etc).</p>
<p>The most important thing about the answer to this question is that you really feel like it matters. I don&rsquo;t care about real estate. I don&rsquo;t care about soft drinks or restaurants. Therefore, I don&rsquo;t own or work for companies that do these things. While I know that these industries serve a purpose in our society, I just don&rsquo;t think they matter as much as the types of things I&rsquo;m doing. Actually, I feel like what I&rsquo;m doing is some of the most important work there is. If you want to know that the business of your heart is beating you have to not only know the answer to this question, you have to really care about it.</p>
<p><strong>What values I stand for?</strong></p>
<p>After deciding why you exist, the second most important question to determine if you&rsquo;re 'on track&rsquo; is to decide how you are going to exist. By this I do not mean things like &ldquo;first we&rsquo;ll offer this product, then we&rsquo;ll add these upgrades, then we&rsquo;ll go after this target market, etc&rdquo;. These things will change all the time. What I mean is the moral or strategic compass that will guide you no matter what decision you are making about the business.</p>
<p>Tony Hseigh, CEO of Zappos.com (acquired by Amazon for $1billion) is fanatical about his company&rsquo;s core values. Things like 'be humble&rsquo;, and 'create fun, and a little weirdness&rsquo; help each person involved in the company know how to handle things like customer service calls (i.e. don&rsquo;t act like you&rsquo;re smarter than the customer, and if you have a great knock knock joke you think they&rsquo;d like, go ahead and share it). They can tell if something is going to diminish or enhance the 'heartbeat&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Kleiner Perkins is one of the most successful venture capital firms in the world. Of their top ten best performing companies ever, eight of them ended up making money with a business model that was different than the one they took investment for. That&rsquo;s like asking for $100 investment to start a lemonade stand and then going out and making millions as a hot dog stand company. So even with the most successful companies, what you actually do is not nearly as predictable or important as knowing why you are doing what you are doing and the principles you will stick to no matter where your journey takes you.</p>
<p>If you know those answers, you&rsquo;ll know that you&rsquo;re on the right track. Better than that, you&rsquo;ll be able to tell when the heart beats, even for a moment. Once you get a glimpse of it, you know you&rsquo;ve brought a dream to life, and that is the thrill of creating something you believe in.</p>
