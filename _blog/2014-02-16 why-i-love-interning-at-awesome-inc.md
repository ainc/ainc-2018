<p>I’m an intern with Team Alpha at Awesome Inc. Team Alpha is not your average internship. Before I interned with Awesome Inc, I interned at a law firm but never did any sort of lawyer stuff. I was pretty much the second secretary but at least I had my own office. All I did was sign thank you cards and organize files. Another time I had to shop for a replacement phone on Cricket because the lawyer had lost his iPhone the day before.</p>

<p>Team Alpha is different. Instead of stereotypical intern work, Garrett, Theresa, and the others find put you to work on projects right away. My first project was to email famous big time entrepreneurs for Rockstar Wall autographs. Before this, my only experience with email was typing it into Facebook to login. It turned out to be pretty successful and I got to ring the Success Bell for the first time after receiving Bill Gates’ autograph. I’ve learned more than just how to email billionaires over my tenure with Team Alpha. Event planning, coding, and pitching ideas are a few of the skills that I wouldn’t have been able to learn anywhere else. </p>

<p>The best part about Team Alpha are the Team Alpha members. I’m always surrounded by the best type of people. A lot of them have rubbed off on me especially the more experienced people like Brian and Nick. Just being around them makes me feel like a boss. Everyone at Team Alpha embodies the overused “work hard, play hard” cliche all over <a href="denied:about:blank" target="_blank">rap music</a>. A lot of times, working hard is playing hard since we always look for a way to mix the two. </p>

<p>Team Alpha isn’t an average internship. You don’t have to worry about phone shopping for anyone. All you have to do is bring your A-game and be ready to do work.</p>
