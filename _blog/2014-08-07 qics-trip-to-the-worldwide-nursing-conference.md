<p>Any entrepreneur will tell you the value of networking.  The more professional connections you can make, the more likely your business is to succeed.  That’s why my company jumped at the chance to meet and interact with people in our field from over a dozen countries at a global conference. On June 23rd and 24th, I attended the Worldwide Nursing Conference in Singapore as a representative of Quality Improvement Connections.</p>
<p><strong>What is Quality Improvement Connections?</strong></p>
<p>Quality Improvement Connections, or QIC for short, is our family startup.   We focus on the creation and implementation of services that increase the quality of healthcare delivery and education.  My mother is a member of the Nursing faculty at Spalding University, and she provides the educational content and knowledge of the field.  It also doesn’t hurt that she knows people everywhere.  My father keeps us on the financial straight and narrow.</p>
<p>My job is to take a body of under-utilized (largely) academic knowledge and turn it into a set of marketable products that can really help improve the state of healthcare in the region.</p>
<p><strong>What does QIC do?</strong></p>
<p>The project we’re currently developing is an online course to teach genetics and genomics to nursing students, and the Worldwide Nursing Conference really acted as our our big reveal.  We spent six months planning to be ready at this event.</p>
<p>This course has been developed following guidelines from the National Institutes of Health.  They’ve set a goal that all nurses and physician assistants should now receive basic instruction in genetics and genomics.  However, the academic infrastructure doesn’t yet exist to make this a feasible goal.  QIC aims to help bridge that chasm by offering a short, self-contained, web-based course in genetics and genomics that meets all the suggested competencies.</p>
<p><strong>Why are we focusing on academic conferences?</strong></p>
<p>Our target market is composed of schools and academic faculty.  We’ve made the calculation/bet that traveling in the academic conference circuit will allow us to network enough to get several schools with the “early adopter” mindset to commit to using our product in the 2014-15 school year.</p>
<p>I have to admit, even though we’re now flying around the world to present at an international conference, even though we’ve got an almost complete product on our hands, and even though we now have serious interest in our product from some pretty big names, it’s tough to shake the feeling that we have no idea what we’re doing.  I’ve read that that’s a feeling everyone deals with when they’re trying to start a business from scratch but it’s obviously an entirely different story to actually have that little seed of doubt.  I think I’ll be 50 before I stop asking myself, “Are we legitimate yet?”</p>
<p>One of the ways to counter that, of course, is to get out and tell the world about our product.  The more people that see our presentations and view our content, the more people will realize we really know what we’re doing, and we’ll be able to continue building our reputation.</p>
<p>Of course, we know we need to be closing sales to be anything other than an advocacy group, but it’s tough to sell to someone who doesn’t yet understand the scope and value of our product.  As we spread the word this way, we’re also working behind the scenes on a more focused regional plan to get the business we need to keep expanding.  In the long term, though, growing the business will only be easier if people already have the name recognition that comes with things like conference appearances and presentations.</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>The Worldwide Nursing Conference was an excellent platform.  The presentation itself was, in my humble opinion, one of the best received in the entire conference.  We met several department heads and administrators from around the world who share an interest in using technology to augment healthcare education.  We made contacts with other professionals whose experiences can help guide our development.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, the paper was published in the official record of the conference, and my mother has already been contacted by another publication interested in the concept to expand on the original concept.  Even though we’re not exactly talking about Nature or Science, these journals are still an excellent way to get noticed by organizations with which we’ve not yet had face-to-face contact.  We’ve already received some attention via this avenue and, as we try to build a footprint in the academic world, amassing publications will continue to be a great way to establish legitimacy and reach a larger audience.</p>
<p><span>We went to Singapore excited, hopeful, and nervous about the reception our ideas would have from a varied international audience.  We came back more excited, more optimistic, and convinced that we’re doing something that will catch attention and turn heads.</span></p>
