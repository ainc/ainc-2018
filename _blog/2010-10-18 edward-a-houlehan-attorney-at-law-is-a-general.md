<p>Edward A. Houlehan, attorney at law, is a general practice attorney. After passing the bar, he did a year as a full time graduate student before forming his own practice. Since there is a distinction between learning law and practicing law, Houlehan is taking cases from different areas of law until he finds what he wants to specialize in.</p>
<p>At first opening his own firm was just a segway before applying for a federal government position, but Houlehan found he really enjoyed being a small firm attorney. He has worked for huge law firm, a judge, and the local government, but none of them appealed to him as much as the challenge of being a solo attorney. Two of his biggest challenges have been tasks that seem simple turning out to be complex and time consuming and being prepared to answer clients&rsquo; unexpected questions.</p>
<p>Houlehan&rsquo;s goals are to be knowledgeable and efficient about law and offer good advice to clients. He wants to learn as much as he can about business law so he can pursue his own independent business objectives. He will likely join with another attorney in the near future.</p>
