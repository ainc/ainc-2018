<p>On an impromptu trip to Cincinnati to celebrate a birthday with a friend, I decided to stop in to Cincinnati&rsquo;s startup accelerator: <a href="http://brandery.org/" target="_blank">The Brandery</a>. Nestled in 3 floors of a historic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italianate_architecture" target="_blank">Italianate</a> building in the midst of the rapidly gentrifying <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_the_rhine" target="_blank">Over-The-Rhine</a>, The Brandery was started by a team of hard working entrepreneurs who wanted to leave their mark on the entrepreneurial scene of The Queen City.</p>
<p>I made my way throughout the building, checking out the space and developing massive office envy over their well groomed coworking space. I ran into representatives from <a href="http://impulcity.com/" target="_blank">Impulcity</a>, <a href="http://crowdhall.com/" target="_blank">CrowdHall</a>, <a href="http://www.flightcar.com/" target="_blank">FlightCar</a> and other startups that have come from all over the country for The Brandery&rsquo;s accelerator program as they sat and played poker over Moerleins and Modelos. We talked about accelerators and entrepreneurship for a short while as they pitched some of their very promising ideas to me. As one of the top 10-15 (depending on which list you consult) accelerator programs in the country, one could tell that these startups were destined for big things thanks to their quality teams and Brandery experience.</p>
<p>The Brandery is a peer accelerator we respect. They have countless mentors and a strong team of &ldquo;Brandsmiths&rdquo; that push creativity and excellence from the fledgeling companies, as well as assist them in the development stages of many of the services they provide. As Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky forms one point of Kentucky-Louisville-Cincinnati&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_%28Kentucky%29" target="_blank">Golden Triangle</a>&rdquo; economic region, it is great for all of us to have such a strong program that attracts so much talent to our part of the country. Keep up the great work, guys!</p>
<p>&hellip;and yes, I am still experiencing extreme office envy, but our ping-pong table is way nicer!</p>
