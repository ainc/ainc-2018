<p>Okay, so this whole idea of a week of ludicrous speed business growth seems to be a bit tough for people to wrap their heads around. I feel you, that makes sense.</p>
<p>If someone came to me and said &ldquo;Hey Luke, I&rsquo;m going get Awesome Inc to go from 100mph to 400 mph starting basically, now,¬ù I would at best be a bit skeptical and at worse just flat out not talk to the guy.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d probably be a bit defensive too, Have you seen how hard we work? I mean, we put on 4 mobile conferences in different cities in 2 months! What are you going to help us put on 16 in the same timeframe?</p>
<p>Fine, we get it. So we decided to show you what&rsquo;s possible in an action packed hour that will simulate just one of the 70+ you&rsquo;ll be putting in in the 6 days of AwesomeCamp.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll go through the 1 hour long clarification process that we do with almost everybody that I help when it&rsquo;s &quot;on purpose&rdquo; (read they actually scheduled some time to meet with me with a clear agenda so we could make some progress). This session will be just a small taste of what the week will be like, but in it we&rsquo;ll be able to DELIVER VALUE in a whole bunch of ways right off the bat by helping you with:</p>

<p><strong>Prioritization</strong> What are you wasting your time on that doesn&rsquo;t matter? THIS STEP ALONE IS WORTH EVERY DIME OF THE CAMP&rsquo;S COST! It could help you shave weeks off right away by simply NOT doing a whole bunch of stuff you think you need to do but actually don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong> You can&rsquo;t do every job so how do you delegate and outsource the others? The answer: Build infrastructure we&rsquo;ll show some examples and help you build some of your own.</p>
<p><strong>Motivation</strong> Worried that you don&rsquo;t have what it takes? We&rsquo;re going to get you pumped up AND we&rsquo;ll point out several people that have LESS talent and potential than you in a lot of ways that are making it happen!</p>
<p><strong>Networking </strong>Want to connect with people that are serious about making their ideas happen? Well, why don&rsquo;t you meet them here? That way you can keep in touch with them and if you don&rsquo;t go to AwesomeCamp you can just have them teach you everything they learned ;)</p>
<p><strong>MORE </strong>We&rsquo;ll have a few fun/funny surprises for you, but that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m telling you for now.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it! <strong>Monday, June 28th at 6pm</strong> - come to a value-packed free event (that we&rsquo;ll be streaming live and posting later for those that can&rsquo;t make it). Get a taste of how AwesomeCamp is going to go down and see if it&rsquo;s something you want to do this summer!</p>
<p>See you there! Until then, follow rule #26 Never let stupid things keep you from doing awesome things.</p>
