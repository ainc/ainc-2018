<p>The inauguration ceremony for the first inducted class of the <a href="http://www.entrepreneurhof.com/" target="_blank">KY Entrepreneur Hall of Fame</a> was exceptionally inspirational for a number of reasons. We had wonderful introductions from some of the HoF team, a fantastic keynote speaker in <a href="http://www.dippindots.com/company/" target="_blank">Curt Jones</a>, and just the presence of such exceptional people was enough to inspire anyone to go out and try to execute on their dream. These things, though, were not a surprise. We had planned them all, expected them to have this effect. What we did not expect was that the event would last almost twice as long as we had planned by very fortunate accident. The acceptance speeches of our inductees invariably turned into stories of their early days, reflections on where their journeys had begun, and it was these stories that were the most moving, educational, and entertaining aspect of the evening by far.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the crowd was limited to only 70 people, and this is something we wanted to change with the Founders Series interviews. The Founders Series interviews is a project put on by the Kentucky Entrepreneur Hall of Fame. Its goal is to share the stories of its inductees and other notable entrepreneurs in the Commonwealth in order to educate and inspire others to pursue equally ambitious and courageous endeavors.</p>
<p>We will be releasing the Founders Series interviews one at a time starting in spring 2011. For now, here are some photos from the interviews.</p>
