<p><span>Everyone, meet Mac. Or rather, say hello again to Mac. Mac Glidewell has been a familiar face around Awesome Inc for quite a while and we’re all ecstatic that he is back and helping out at the space again.</span></p>
<p>Glidewell was first introduced to Awesome Inc through his business endeavor Tagapet, a scannable pet tag that sends GPS information to the pet’s owner when scanned, as well as linking the scanner to a pet profile complete with name and picture. Tagapet caught Awesome Inc’s attention by winning the Elevator Pitch contest while Mac and business partner Michael were students at the University of Kentucky; soon after, Tagapet became a part of Awesome Inc’s second accelerator in 2012.</p>
<p>During Glidewell’s time with Awesome Inc, Tagapet was accepted into an international business accelerator in Amsterdam, and the team relocated to the Netherlands for three months. Unfortunately, their attempt to launch a new version of Tagapet with a real time tracker didn’t go as well as was hoped, and eventually the team came home in February 2014.</p>
<p>Even though the new tag didn’t take off as planned, returning to the states was far from a failure. Glidewell moved back to Lexington to attend the UK and reconnected with the Awesome Inc family. He can now be found at the space helping out as the Head of Mentor Relations. He’ll be working with <span>Awesome Inc</span>’s fellowship teams, providing advice from his past entrepreneurial experience, leading communications sessions on learning customer language and connecting with mentors, as well as bringing more mentors to the program and sending out a monthly newsletter.</p>
<p>Mac is excited to be back with Awesome Inc, saying that he really supports <span>Awesome Inc</span> and the community formed around our mission. The Fellowship is lucky to have his entrepreneurial background and positive attitude back on board and can’t wait to see all the awesome he’s going to bring to Team Alpha!</p>
