description: Everyone wears clothes but not everything needs to be new!

The current fashion industry is filled with changing trends; some new, and some recycled from the past. This leaves the fashion industry scrambling to keep up with the constant change. Whether you’re a pajama aficionado, a high fashionista, or the next Steve Jobs lookalike… this article is for you. 

“Everyone wears clothes but not everything needs to be new '' is a lesson I’ve learned time and again as I created my secondhand clothing business, [Trends by Linds](https://www.instagram.com/trends.bylinds/).  This idea started because I grew up struggling to see myself as beautiful or worthy. One of my main goals in creating this business was to make people feel beautiful and gain back their confidence. Along with that I have learned beauty is *NOT* something the world defines for me, but instead it is something we each hold and express in our own unique way.  

With those lessons in mind, I wanted to show people that there are other ways to shop than buying things first hand/fast fashion. I started this business not only for something to do but also because I found something I am deeply passionate about. 

*So, what the heck is fast fashion?*

Remember earlier when I mentioned how fast trends change in the fashion industry? Fast fashion is inexpensive clothing that is mass-produced by large companies. Maybe you’re wondering why fast fashion is so bad… What can be better than inexpensive trendy clothes?!

**First, some fast facts:**

* It takes **700** gallons of water to produce *ONE* cotton shirt and **2,000** gallons of water to produce *ONE* pair of jeans.
* Synthetic materials are the *PRIMARY* culprits to plastic microfibers that have entered our ocean.
* **57%** of all discarded clothing ends up in a landfill which then moves to an area to be incinerated. This is dangerous not only to the environment but also to the public health of any community living nearby.
* **85%** of garment workers get paid 2-6 cents per piece, working 60-70 hour weeks in extremely unsafe conditions.

The good news? There's a huge community of creatives, entrepreneurs, and environmentalists who are dedicated to finding different ways to sell sustainable clothing. 

Here's how **YOU** can help support sustainable fashion companies… even if you don’t buy from them!

**1. Continue to educate yourself.**

* Where are you buying your products from, who is producing those products, and how are they being produced? These are important questions to ask as you’re making purchase decisions.
* Do a deep dive and see for yourself why we shouldn’t support fast fashion brands.

**2. Find, follow, and support the sustainable fashion community in your city.**

* Lexington has a large secondhand fashion community
* Here are 5 of my personal favorites:

**3. Talk about it!**

* Don’t be afraid to share with others what you find and where you find it… nobody likes a gatekeeper.
* When you buy from a local business, post a story about it! It’s quick and easy for you and they’ll love and appreciate the free advertising.
* WEAR IT! YOU are the best billboard a company can have.

Fashion is about more than just the new and trendy. There is a whole new-to-you world that’s begging to be uncovered.
