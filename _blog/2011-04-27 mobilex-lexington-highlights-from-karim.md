<p>Last week, I had the honor of attending, and speaking at, the Mobilex conference in Lexington, KY. This 1 day conference brought together mobile enthusiasts of all types: entrepreneurs, investors, developers, and other related industry professionals.</p>

<p>Being a technologist, and since my talk was a technical one, I spent most of my time in the developer track, but I did manage to breach the entrepreneur track a little bit as well. Some of the highlights of the event included:</p>
<ul><li>Keynote with Brian Wong: Brian is the founder of <a href="http://www.kiip.me/" target="_blank">Kiip.me</a>, a mobile in-game advertising system and is the youngest entrepreneur to ever get VC funding at 19. <img border="0" class="alignnone" height="160" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5229/5625844822_5b5e16ed17_m.jpg" title="brian" width="240"/></li>
</ul><ul><li>My talk on tablets and cross-platform strategies: I can&rsquo;t help but give a shout out to myself. <img border="0" class="alignnone" height="16" src="http://cngddp.i.lithium.com/i/smilies/16x16_smiley-happy.gif" title="smiley" width="16"/> <img border="0" class="alignnone" height="160" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5027/5625181305_5dd2e0aa97_m.jpg" title="karim" width="240"/></li>
</ul><ul><li><a href="http://www.mavizontech.com/MeetMavia.htm" target="_blank">Mavia</a>: A device and and app that connects you intimately with your car. <img border="0" class="alignnone" height="160" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5148/5625841578_b744e5b409_m.jpg" title="mavia" width="240"/></li>
</ul><ul><li>An Android Developer Workshop led by Uki Lucas of <a href="http://chicagoandroid.com/" target="_blank">ChicagoAndroid.com</a>. <img border="0" class="alignnone " height="160" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5067/5625189611_6b23c7302b_m.jpg" title="uki" width="240"/></li>
</ul><p>Overall, the conference was a huge success, and a sellout. It&rsquo;s great to see this kind of innovation going on in mobile in this part of the country, no offense to my southern compatriots!</p>
