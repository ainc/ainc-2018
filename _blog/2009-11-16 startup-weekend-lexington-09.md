<p><br/><br/><a href="http://lexington.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">Startup Weekend</a> is coming to Lexington for the 2nd year in a row on Nov 20-22, 2009. Startup Weekend is a 54 hour startup event that provides networking, resources, and incentives for individuals and teams to go from idea to launch. It is all about building community, starting companies and ultimately following <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/rules" target="_blank">rule #22</a>: go big or don&rsquo;t be my friend¬ù. Everyone who attends Startup Weekend goes big in the sense that they commit to making strides towards turning their idea into a company in less than three days. The event is intentionally limited in structure to allow for participants to spend most of their time doing work. The primary purpose of Startup Weekend is to DO SOMETHING. Spend very little time talking about your idea and most of the time doing something toward launching your idea. <br/><br/>There are two major benefits to attending Startup Weekend. First is the networking opportunity - You will meet local developers, innovators, business leaders, and entrepreneurs. Over the course of the three day event, meaningful relationships are built and valuable connections are made. The second benefit is to harness the power of community. We expect about 75 participants to attend Startup Weekend this year. So instead of working on your latest ground-breaking idea in the basement of your house, join a bunch of other like-minded individuals at Startup Weekend. For the same reason that people are more motivated while working out at a gym, participants at Startup Weekend reap the benefits of working among a group of other motivated individuals. <br/><br/>Startup Weekend was started in 2007 by <a href="http://andrewhy.de/" target="_blank">Andrew Hyde</a>. The program has traveled to over 52 cities and 12 countries. The program is now run by Marc Nager and Clint Nelson out of Seattle, WA. This year&rsquo;s event in Lexington is part of Global Entrepreneurship week. Lexington is one of seven cities hosting a Startup Weekend during the weekend of Nov 20th.</p>
<p><br/>  <br/>Last year&rsquo;s event had about 65 attendees and 8 companies were formed. One of those companies is called<a href="http://uvestor.com/" target="_blank">Uvestor</a>. Led by John Williamson, Uvestor is a real estate communication platform where investors, real estate agents, brokers, and landlords can be connected instantly. Uvestor turned out to be such a success that John now runs the company full time. <br/><br/>Get more info at <a href="http://lexington.startupweekend.org/" target="_blank">http://lexington.startupweekend.org</a> <br/><br/>Event Details Date/Time: Friday, Nov 20 6pm, Sunday, Nov 22 7pm Location: <a href="http://www.awesomeinc.org/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc</a> @ 348 East Main Street, Lexington, KY 40507 Cost: $40, includes 7 meals and a t-shirt.
