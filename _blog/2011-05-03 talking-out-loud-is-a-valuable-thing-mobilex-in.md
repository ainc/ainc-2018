<p>Now for the value to me personally I&rsquo;ve realized that any time I&rsquo;m invited to lead a breakout session or speak to other entrepreneurs it forces me to step back and recalibrate my thoughts and attitudes. This helps me make sure I still believe in what we are doing and how we are doing it.</p>
<p>My take away from this engagement was the re-confirmation that being refreshingly transparent about what is and isn&rsquo;t in your business is key. In the startup world you see some of the best bizdev people you&rsquo;re ever going to see. Sometimes too good. All too often you see a great speaker with magical points on how to lead people to success. The problem is often time these guys are really exaggerating what really exists in their business. I won&rsquo;t call them lies exactly so much as exaggerations that lead to disappointment. So is this wrong? I&rsquo;m not so sure. It is a fine line bizdev people walk.</p>
<p>My solution? I try to be as transparent as possible. For example, during this talk I made it clear that we are not out of the woods yet. Just because you take some form of funding, get media attention, or hire people, doesn&rsquo;t mean your company is a success. This is another point I like to share with would-be startup guys: what is the end game? In fact, I often ask this of people we hire at Mavizon. If the end game is to raise 10 million in capital then retire as soon as you can, you probably need a wake up call. In <a href="http://37signals.com/rework/" target="_blank">Rework</a> they call it a commitment strategy. I think it is more of a reality plan. I love to dream as much as the next guy, but if you think retiring on a yacht is the goal you&rsquo;re nutty. What would these people do on a yacht for the last 70 years of their life.</p>

<p><em>I thought it might be a good thing to gather my thoughts from the MobileX conference I spoke at a few weeks ago in Lexington, KY. MobileX is a gathering of mobile startups, investors, idea guys, coders, etc., to talk about lessons learned, how-tos, and what&rsquo;s next in the mobile space. The event was started in Lexington by Awesome Inc., an incubator/co-work space.</em></p>
<p>The MobileX conference was fairly successful for all involved. For the hosts, they enjoyed a large crowd, a decent local media flow, and even a few Lexington big wigs stopped in. As for the attendees, well they enjoyed some great breakout sessions from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/brian_wong" target="_blank">Brian Wong</a>, CEO of <a href="http://kiip.me/" target="_blank">Kiip.me</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nihalmehta" target="_blank">Nihal Mehta</a>, CEO of<a href="http://localresponse.com/" target="_blank">localresponse.com</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/samsoffes" target="_blank">Sam Soffees</a>, engineer at <a href="http://www.scribd.com/" target="_blank">Scribd.com</a>. Any person with an ounce of drive in them I&rsquo;m sure was inspired and fired up to get out of the conference to build something.</p>

<p>I like business. It is like a drug. If one business fails, or succeeds, I&rsquo;m sure everyone at Mavizon will be looking for whats next and that&rsquo;s a very cool thing.</p>
<p>As I shared these thoughts at the mobile conference, I wasn&rsquo;t sure how they would be received from a group of people with dollar signs in their eyes talking to VCs. I was pleasantly surprised when a number of people approached me and wanted to talk. I hope they gained some value from the ideas shared, but the fact is there is no rule book. If anybody had the right answers, we&rsquo;d have a lot more successful startups. That is about where I ended with the talk, and I&rsquo;ll do the same with this post, treat your business like an art. Art doesn&rsquo;t have rules and neither does startup culture. Even so, everyone seems to know good art when they see it.</p>
