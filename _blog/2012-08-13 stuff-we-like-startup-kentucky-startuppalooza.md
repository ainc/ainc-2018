<p><strong>DEMO Fall 2012 Contest!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.s.co/" target="_blank">Startup America</a> is partnering with DEMO to send eight lucky startups to <a href="http://www.demo.com/ehome/index.php?eventid=29414&amp;" target="_blank">DEMO Fall 2012</a>! Four startups will receive space at the DEMO Showcase Pavilion and four will present on the main stage, following in the footsteps of companies like E*TRADE, Salesforce, and TiVO who each debuted at DEMO.</p>
<p>Each Startup America region (including KY) is hosting a statewide contest to choose one startup who will be entered into the national competition hosted by Startup America. Startups will submit a 1-minute video clip pitching the company, the problem they&rsquo;re solving, why they&rsquo;re the most creative, and why their team is the one that can successfully bring their product to market.</p>
<p><strong>The pitch contest begins Wednesday, August 8 and ends Friday, August 17.</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll announce the Startup Kentucky region winner on August 24. Stay tuned, because on September 15 we&rsquo;ll announce the 8 companies from across the country who will attend DEMO 2012.</p>
