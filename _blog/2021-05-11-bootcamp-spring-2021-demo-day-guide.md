By Nick Such

We are only a few days away from the conclusion of the latest Web Developer Bootcamp program (our 10th!), and we are excited for you to see how far this group of students has come in just a few months. [Demo Day](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/awesome-inc-demo-day-web-developer-bootcamp-spring-2021-registration-148021754051) is scheduled for Thursday, May 13th. This event is an opportunity for these brand-new developers to showcase their skills through a capstone project, a full-stack web application.

We’re always impressed by the backgrounds of our students before bootcamp, and this group doesn’t disappoint. They’ve worked in management, manufacturing and music. They’ve won 100-person video game tournaments and taught others how to fly airplanes. They’ve helped run small businesses, or even have plans to start their own. And now they know how to turn ideas into plans, plans into code, and code into software solutions for real-world problems.

Our Demo Days have looked different over the past year, but that hasn’t stopped our alumni from landing jobs with local and remote employers, and with growing starting salaries. This spring, while most of our attendees are still joining via Zoom, we’re excited to be able to host a small group of employer representatives in-person. For our remote attendees (or those watching the recording), we are offering some details in this post on how to access an in-depth project review from each student, as well as an opportunity to ask questions or share feedback.

## Demo Day Logistics

### Ask questions any time

In addition to providing a brief live presentation about themselves, their journey, and their project, our students have pre-recorded a more detailed video walkthrough showing their projects in action. This video also provides an opportunity for attendees to share questions and comments with each student. You can also connect with our students via LinkedIn through the profile links below.
