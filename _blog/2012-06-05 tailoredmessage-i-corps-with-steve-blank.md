<p>This spring, a select group of <a href="http://cis.uky.edu/inet/" target="_blank">iNET</a> (Innovation Network for Entrepreneurial Thinking) board members from the University of Kentucky received a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant called I-CORPS.</p>
<p>A team of UK students and faculty and local entrepreneurs, including Dr. Dan O'Hair, Dr. Derek Lane, Wes Brooks, Randall Stevens, and Jennifer Dupuis, participated in the I-CORPS Program – a 10-week intensive course taught by Silicon Valley entrepreneur <a href="http://steveblank.com/" target="_blank">Steve Blank</a> and other successful entrepreneurs. The first week and last week of the program was spent in Stanford, CA learning directly from experts in the field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The first week was like a boot camp that prepared us for the 10 weeks of hard work ahead of us. The last week was a lot more about learning how to present our ideas and the knowledge we had gained in an effective way to customers and to investors. It was a really great experience.</em>&rdquo; – Wes Brooks</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We started with the idea of using tailored messages – messages designed uniquely for each individual – for hurricane evacuations, because that&rsquo;s where we did our earlier research. But once we started talking to customers during that first week in Stanford, we realized right away that healthcare is where we can make a real difference, and where there is a need for this type of science</em>.&rdquo; - Dan O'Hair, Principal Investigator on the grant.</p>
<p>Blank embraces the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.stevenblank.com/startup_index_qty.html" target="_blank">Customer Development</a>&rdquo; philosophy of business creation. Throughout the ten weeks, the team was challenged to speak to 100 customers to learn whether their idea could be sold. Teams were expected to &ldquo;pivot&rdquo; their idea as customers contribute suggestions, criticisms, and the all-important answer to the question, &ldquo;would you buy this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jennifer Dupuis, was added to the team after TailoredMessage pivoted to healthcare, shifting the primary goal to &lsquo;improve patient outcomes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>We want to help hospitals and healthcare providers connect with their patients and provide tools that help patients be healthier. I&rsquo;m excited to apply my health communications research to a technology solution that could really improve people&rsquo;s lives</em>.&rdquo; – Jennifer Dupuis</p>
<p>The team is working to develop a website that is free to patients and allows them access to their electronic health records. Physicians will be able to check in with their patients, send customized messages, and track health data across diseases and/or demographics.</p>
<p>Now that the I-CORPS program has wrapped up, Brooks states &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to turn this into a real business.&quot; </p>
