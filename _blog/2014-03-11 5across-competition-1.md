<p>The first Lexington <a href="http://www.5across.org/" target="_blank">5 Across</a> competition of 2014 is now in the books, with Seth McBee of <a href="http://yousawme.com" target="_blank">Seke LLC</a> taking the first victory on February 26th. Seth has patented an LED embedded safety vest that can alternate colors and lighting frequency to truly help people be seen and stay safe. Joining Seth is the winning team from the text vote, Arymza Technologies, a team that is working to commercialize a proprietary enzyme for breaking down starch more efficiently. </p>

<p>We had four teams competing this time as opposed to the usual five, technically making this only the second ever “4 Across,” but nonetheless, the competition was fierce. Rounding out the rest of the teams were Weather Resistance Structures, a team that has created a system for structurally reinforcing houses and buildings in hurricane or tornado danger areas, and <a href="http://www.eazycrease.com/" target="_blank">Eazy Crease</a>, a tool to allow easier marking of sports fields, such as basketball courts or soccer fields. </p>
<p><br/>The next 5 Across is coming up at the end of April &ndash; stay tuned for updates on that event and many others.
