<p>Mark your calendars folks, the next <a href="http://www.5across.org/" target="_blank">5 Across</a> is coming up this week on October 29th. This month’s edition consists of an eclectic mix of companies competing for the prize of $500 and a shot at competing in the 2014 Finals event on December 10. I bet that you’ve been getting antsy for your 5 Across fix, so here’s a quick preview of the companies that will be pitching.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://oascreates.com/" target="_blank">Ockham Applied Sciences</a> - Cycle by Cycle - Jon Dale</strong></p>
<p>Jon Dale will be pitching his Cycle by Cycle Industrial Pacing Light that improves productivity to provide real-time measurement of how well a job is being performed. Henry Ford probably wishes he thought of this one.</p>
<p><span></span><strong>Aesop Solutions - The Rover</strong></p>
<p>This company started by Janine and Will Coy-Geeslin, Pat Kelly, Catherine Staib, and Alex Geyling is developing a machine that picks up tennis balls during practice or play so you don’t have to. Could this spell the beginning of the end of ball boys?</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.lovemebloncho.com/" target="_blank">The LMBblanket</a> - Kathy Sanders</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever imagined what a blanket and poncho’s baby would look like? Well, Kathy Sanders’ LMBblanket is exactly what you thought of but better. The Snuggie ain’t got nothing on this cozy thing. </p>
<p><strong>Healthy Nation - Jared, Josh, and Heather Young</strong></p>
<p>The Youngs want you to start eating your veggies. They created a product that changes the taste of those leafy greens into more palatable flavors.  Maybe I can finally fulfill my dream of bacon flavored everything.</p>
<p><span></span><strong><a href="http://www.qic-ky.com/" target="_blank">Quality Improvement Connections</a> - Delwin and Ben Jacoby</strong></p>
<p>Delwin and Ben Jacoby are going to pitch a Mini Course focused on teaching nurse practitioners and physician assistants Genetics and Genomics. I wonder if there are any instructions on cloning myself in there.</p>
<p>It looks like we’re gonna have another high quality group of companies. Hopefully, you can wait out the next couple days for this one until then, don’t forget to buy your tickets <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/5-across-lexington-october-2014-tickets-12947118179" target="_blank">here</a>. Also, we&rsquo;re gonna throw in some new things you&rsquo;ve never seen before. See you at Awesome Inc on October 29th! Bring a friend!</p>
