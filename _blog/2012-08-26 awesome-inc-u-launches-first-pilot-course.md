<p>Beginning on July 31st, Awesome Inc launched its first pilot educational program to drum up interest in and teach technical and design skills within the community. The first course, offered exclusively to Awesome Inc staff and interns, is a coding course in the popular programming language <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">Python</a>. Held on the back ping-pong table in the break room, students get a foundation in both computer science application and theory, as well as the occasional history lesson. Attendance has been excellent, with more than 10 people showing up to each course.</p>
<p><a href="http://buildinglayer.com/" target="_blank">BuildingLayer</a>&rsquo;s Nick Such, the organizer of this course, is learning coding skills along with the rest of the class as it progresses. He also hopes to hold future courses, which may or may not be public. Possible future course titles include: &ldquo;Your First Wordpress Website&rdquo;, &ldquo;Intro to Django&rdquo;, &ldquo;Your First Android App&rdquo; and a collaborative attempt at Stanford's <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-apps-for-ios-fall/id495054839" target="_blank">Designing Apps for iOS</a> course. All of these courses are taught entirely from free materials from sites like <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/" target="_blank">Learn Python the Hard Way</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a>, <a href="http://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a>, and <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/" target="_blank">iTunes U</a>.</p>
<p>If you have an interest in learning to code and have yet to take initiative, it&rsquo;s never too late to start early! We&rsquo;re always looking for new members of <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/Blog/seeking-awesome-interns" target="_blank">Team Alpha</a>, Awesome Inc&rsquo;s internship program, which is allowed full, free access to the courses. So far, we&rsquo;ve all had a great time and love throwing around our new titles of &ldquo;computer programmer&rdquo; in the office! Stay Awesome!</p>
