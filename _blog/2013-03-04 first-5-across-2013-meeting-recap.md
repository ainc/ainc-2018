<p><a href="http://5across.org/" target="_blank">5 Across</a> returned to Lexington on Wednesday for the first meeting of 2013. Five competitive teams pitched their company ideas to a panel of judges made up of seasoned entrepreneurs as well as a full crowd who braved slippery roads and cold weather to be in attendance.</p>
<p>Teams included:</p>
<p>Justin and Lauren Fox pitched <strong>NoRoom LLC</strong>, a team heavily involved within Lexington&rsquo;s thriving video game industry that creates video game entertainment for gamers of the Christian Faith.</p>
<p>Grant Weherly pitched<strong> Control My ADHD</strong>, a subscription-based video service for those with ADHD to help get their lives in order. Control My ADHD was one of fourteen pitches at <a href="http://ci.uky.edu/inet/page/uk-venture-challenge" target="_blank">UK&rsquo;s Venture Challenge competition</a>.</p>
<p>Jeffery Billion and Kevin Yates pitched <strong>Career-Match</strong>, an online service matching job applicants with vacant jobs using details profiles, going beyond the resume.</p>
<p>Brian Johnson, Ryan Riddle, and Robyn Kaw pitched <strong>The Unity Box</strong>, new home automation hardware that learns your daily routine to save home owners energy and money. Like Control My ADHD, Home Unity also pitched at the 2013 UK Venture Challenge.</p>
<p>Zach Pennington and Josh Strange pitched<strong><a href="https://giftpool.co/" target="_blank"> GiftPool</a></strong>, a crowd-funding website for giving gifts, allowing family and friends to pool money to purchase more expensive gifts. GiftPool also won the first prize at Startup Weekend Lexington 2012.</p>
<p>GiftPool took home the $500 prize for their crowd-funding platform centered around giving gifts. They will be given the opportunity to pitch at the 5 Across Finals in December as well the Lexington Venture Club in March. Home Unity won the audience text vote for their excellent pitch of The Unity Box.</p>
<p>The night&rsquo;s excellent pitches and heavy turnout resulted in another great event for Lexington&rsquo;s startup community. Congratulations to all of the teams who participated and we offer a special thanks to our sponsors and friends who help make 5 Across happen! Be sure not to miss 2013&rsquo;s second meeting of 5 Across Wednesday April 24th where five teams will once again compete for the $500 prize.</p>
