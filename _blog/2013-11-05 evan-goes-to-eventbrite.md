<p>Our city of Lexington is thriving with small businesses and an entrepreneurial spirit. But what happens when you take that environment and add a lot more technology and more startups? You get San Francisco, and that’s exactly where former Awesome Inc team member Evan Leach is today.</p>

<p>In a city full of culture and ideas, it’s easy to be at a coffee shop and “hear conversations about art and culture, or in different languages,” Evan said. Evan’s been granted a job at Eventbrite, the online ticketing service founded in San Francisco. Though he’s only been working there for a month, he said he’s learned a lot and explained the thrill of seeing immediate results, such as changing details on the site or mobile app and seeing results in the user experience and traffic.</p>

<p>“It’s very metrics driven,” he said. “You really get to see actions with results faster than a startup, where it instead works in very incremental changes.”</p>

<p>Being at Eventbrite has exceeded his expectations and proven to be a great thing to happen to him because he’s never been able to work on such large and complex projects, “As a designer, I love big problems, so this job is perfect.”</p>

<p>And even though he shared his awe of San Francisco and the eager technology buzz, he attributes all of his values and knowledge to where it started for him: Awesome Inc. When asked about the most important thing he found at Awesome Inc, without a pause, he answered that it was the people. He raved about the people and the environment at Awesome Inc, saying, “the people there are extremely driven, know what they want, are so hopeful and passionate: it’s infectious.”</p>

<p>He stressed that the great guys that started Awesome Inc created an environment where people can thrive and do good things. “Put a bunch of talented people in a room, add those guys, and nothing but good can come out of it,” he said.</p>

<p>One of the things that I was most fascinated with Evan was his optimism. He shared his experience in the app he created for baseball fans, Crowded &ndash; an app he and his team could have written off as a failure, but didn’t. I was amazed at his half-full glass that he shared about how he and his team looked at not reaching their goals as a positive thing.</p>

<p>“We walked away from it with a lot of knowledge,” Evan said. “Even now, we’re all applying knowledge everyday that we learned from Crowded and using the tools that we were taught in that experience.”</p>

<p>His most important piece of advice is to take risks and to know that, no matter what happens, it’ll pay off in the end. Most of the people he’s working with now aren’t starting career paths, but rather have been able to start businesses, fend for themselves, see the large scope for a company and become an efficient human being with that same risk-taking mindset.</p>

<p>“Even if the risk you’re taking isn’t your end goal, it gives you a platform to build upon.” Evan said.</p>

<p>Evan is a young guy with a (Event)brite future ahead of him. Though his professional path may take him many places, he emphasized that right now, his number one job is to learn. He laughed and said, “from the moment I get to work, I learn. And my rule is that I work and learn until my computer runs out of power. I’m just trying to absorb as much as I can.”</p>

<p>When it comes to his long-term goals, Evan mentioned that he still had the “startup bug” that infiltrates the city of San Francisco. “I’m really enjoying what I’m doing right now.” he said. “Especially at my age, I want to be really good at what I do. So many exciting things are happening in my head right now; I’m learning how design and technology work with people. I hope to continue working, become more involved with startups, and take more risks. Really, I’m just going one step at a time.”</p>

<p>And of course, here at Awesome Inc, being ‘awesome’ is a really big aspect of the thriving environment. On defining what awesome meant to him, Evan said that his definition is constantly changing, but the core of it is “taking initiative and executing what you think is best.” He related it to all aspects of his life and said that if he wants to be a friend, he wants to build a strong level of trust and help them out. “The same goes for a coworker,” he said. “I want to not only help people succeed, but execute it at a high degree as well.”</p>

<p>Thinking upon it again, he made sure to emphasize that the core values that are established at Awesome Inc are what he still holds true today. He says he values his experience in Lexington and attributes a lot of where he is today to the things he learned there and the people who helped him.</p>

<p>Evan is the kind of person that truly loves what he does and the life he’s living out, whether it be trying out the foods of San Francisco or becoming one of the “distinct tribes” of people who love what they’re doing. After speaking to Evan, I realized that he’s the perfect example of exemplifying everything Awesome Inc. strives to be. He’s living out his life to be good, be excellent, be a friend, and be him, which altogether, makes him a pretty awesome guy.</p>
