<p>We&rsquo;re sad to say it&rsquo;s closing out time&hellip; This summer has been a great experience for all involved. Special thanks to all the program&rsquo;s supporters and mentors. The teams have come such a long way since June, but they still have work to do and we&rsquo;re excited to see where they take it from here. We&rsquo;ll still be mentoring them along the way and they can still use your help!</p>
