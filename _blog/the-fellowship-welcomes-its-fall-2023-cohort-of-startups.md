With a steadfast commitment to nurturing innovation, this program offers a unique blend of support, ranging from metrics accountability to invaluable services such as design, videography, development, legal, and accounting. 

In this round, we proudly welcome a diverse group of startups that are set to make waves in the outdoors and health and wellness sectors. As we embark on this exciting journey, we look forward to witnessing the transformation and evolution of these pioneering companies over the coming year. The future of Kentucky's startup ecosystem is brighter than ever, thanks to these [trailblazing entrepreneurs](https://www.awesomeinc.org/fellowship/portfolio) and the Awesome Inc Fellowship Program.

Wicked Technologies specializes in bedding and sleep products that both detect and mitigate issues associated with excess moisture. Their newest product, the Wicked Smart Pad is a washable, sensorized pad that wirelessly transmits spill data/events to caregivers.

After experiencing personal loss related to the surprising and devastating effects of excess moisture, Founder Alli Truttmann is aided by the memory of a loved one as she builds a solution that will save lives and help caregivers provide increased comfort to those in vulnerable stages of their lives.

[NonBinary Solutions](https://www.nonbinarysolutions.com/)

* Lexington, KY
* Mandy Ralston

NonBinary Solutions’ software, Knowetic, brings standardization of clinical decision making to a highly variable service industry and helps personalize and optimize outcomes for the extremely heterogeneous group of people that share a single diagnostic label of AUTISM.

Founder, Mandy Ralston, is executing an effective alpha model approach which involves building solutions for early adopting partners and then utilizing validation metrics for more future users of the ever-scalable Knowetic product.

With more than 25 years of clinical experience, Mandy Ralston is an invited speaker nationwide and may utilize her platform to grow NonBinary.

Over the upcoming year, these Fellowship companies will engage in a comprehensive and collaborative journey. They will regularly participate in metrics accountability meetings, where their progress and performance will be closely monitored and optimized. In addition to individual growth, they will come together to support one another in group resource settings, fostering an environment of mutual learning and innovation. The experience will be further enriched with a startup summer retreat, providing them with an opportunity to connect, learn, and rejuvenate. Furthermore, these companies are not only focused on their own growth but are also committed to giving back to the entrepreneurial community by supporting contestants of the [5 Across Entrepreneur Pitch Competition](https://www.awesomeinc.org/events/5across), thus contributing to the broader ecosystem of innovation and opportunity. This holistic approach to fellowship promises an exciting year of growth, collaboration, and community engagement.
