It was standing room only as Digi-books, Renegade, The Minipantry, PASIV Duty, and OpenEddi presented their pitches.</p><p>Digi-books got the night rolling with their pitch about a program that provides video summaries of a chapter, blogs, and additional assistance regarding a chapter or the book as a whole.</p><p>Renegade kept the energy up with their pitch about creating your own sustainable off grid home. These homes offer unique features that make each one special to the homebuilder.</p><p>The Minipantry followed with a fantastic pitch about single-use spice packets that reduce cost and waste for consumers.</p><p>PASIV Duty brought their idea to the table about a safety and communication device designed for police officers and other law enforcement.</p><p>Concluding the night was a pitch by OpenEddi, a company designed to create software that makes data collection powerful and interesting.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="427" data-orig-width="640"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/fc1ac2012b52a396e11545bea654eff2/tumblr_inline_ofxj7rs8cF1spm8pc_540.jpg" data-orig-height="427" data-orig-width="640"/></figure><p>The crowd vote winner, which is determined by an app used during the event, was Digi-books.
