<p><strong>This upcoming Five Across meeting will feature the following entrepreneurs/businesses:</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Eric Gaines</strong> will be presenting Party Tutor which will provide college students with an easy to use smartphone app/website to access everything they need to allow them to have an awesome college experience as well as saving money at the same time!</p>
<p>• <strong>Grant Weherley</strong> and his team will be pitching SmartLit which is a bluetooth controllable outlet which can be set to automatically turn on or off when you leave your house (by detecting that your phone is out of range)</p>
<p>• <strong>Cameron Lippert</strong> will be pitching Last Call Beverages, which is a Beverage for hangover pre-treatment. This beverage, when taken during alcohol consumption, will scavenge the toxins produced from alcohol metabolism therefore reducing hangover sympton or even preventing them all together.</p>
<p>• <strong>Edward Wood</strong> will be presenting EHW, LLC which will create an improved walker for the elderly. Many current medical devices are &ldquo;sterile,&rdquo; lack emotionally supportive design, and convey a sense of morbid responsibility. This causes people to not use home-health products when they should. This problem is solved by designing a walker that people simply want to use. A device that has an organic feel, friendly features, and enticing curves.</p>
<p>• <strong>Tom Dugan</strong> will be pitching Bluestone Geologic, which provides Geologic Mapping Services – Aquifers &amp; groundwater development; sinkholes &amp; build site evaluation (pre &amp; post build) using geophysical equipment &amp; techniques applied to detailed underground mapping.</p>
<p><strong>Be sure to come out to the second event of 2012, enjoy the food and drinks, socialize with investors, entrepreneurs and other like-minded people, and hear these entrepreneurs pitch their exciting new business ideas and take home a prize of $500.</strong></p>
