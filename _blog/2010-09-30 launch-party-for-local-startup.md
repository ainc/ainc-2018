<p>A new startup is launching in Lexington, and they&rsquo;re having a party to celebrate. Punndit (<a href="http://punndit.com/" target="_blank">punndit.com</a>) is a contextual video blogging company that allows users to respond to and interact with all forms of nonprint media; this essentially means being able to respond to video with video. While there are many uses for this new platform, their starting focuses are sports and politics, since there are already lots of opinions and content for these topics.</p>
<p>Owner Randall Stevens has 20 years experience in software development businesses. He&rsquo;s had the idea for video blogging for 10 years, but the timing hasn&rsquo;t been right until now. There are no other companies doing this, and the technology of having cameras in mobile devices and computers has finally caught up. Right now they are in the early stages of turning their idea into reality, and need customer feedback.</p>
<p>At the launch party, guests will be able to use Punndit and start generating content. Punndit will get feedback from a broader audience and guests will be the first to see the newest technology. This is also a time to celebrate and share with family and friends what they&rsquo;ve been working on. The party is Thursday October 7th, from 8pm-11pm at the Punndit Offices at 163 East Main Street, 3rd Floor. Guests are asked to indicate they are attending at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=159836000693687&amp;index=1" target="_blank">http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=159836000693687&amp;index=1</a>.</p>
