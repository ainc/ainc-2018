<p>The June 22nd 5 Across event was yet another success (see <a href="http://awesomeinc.org/www.5across.org" target="_blank">www.5across.org</a>). The 5 pitches were:</p>
<p>Matt Fulton, pitched The Clubhouse, which is designed to provide the golf community with an outlet to play golf during the winter/rainy off-season and nighttime, or other times when traditional golf is not an option. In addition, The Clubhouse will provide a casual environment to eat sophisticated yet uncomplicated food with alcohol service and access to televised sporting events.</p>
<p><img alt="Glowb" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5236/5889005832_0842bb1dfa.jpg" width="200"/>Laurel Christensen, pitched the Glowb, a self-contained night light that projects patterns on surrounding surfaces, instantly transforming the space which it is in. It is a 20-sided geometric solid, an icosahedron, with a pattern cut out of each face. It is powered by 4 AA batteries which can be easily changed by opening one of the faces.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Lorch, pitched The Green Giant which is a portable, solar/diesel hybrid power station. The multi-functional power generating station features a 24 VDC power train which more efficiently generates energy, requiring less to operate, thus making it&rsquo;s primary solar source much more feasible. It uses a hybrid power system utilizing two solar panels and a diesel fueled Auxiliary Power Unit . The Green Giant can also play a significant role in disaster relief operations as it can simultaneously illuminate a search area, pump air/oxygen into a location should a victim be found, and communicate via video and/or cellular to operation centers while the victim is being extricated.</p>
<p>Ben Freeman and Tyler Yarbrough, pitched Betabase, which is a first person, high definition video guidebook of popular rock climbing routes throughout the country starting with the Red River Gorge as a test piece. From these videos, they can also create 3D panoramic maps of rock faces using the still images which can be manipulated by climbers who want to study their projects at their leisure.</p>
<p>Eric Hartman, pitched The ACLerator, which is a physical therapy device for the sports medicine / rehabilitation market. The device is intended for muscle strengthening during post-surgical knee immobilization following Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACLR) or Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA).</p>
<p><img alt="Eric Hartman" src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5303/5888480929_f7247edb95_z.jpg" width="300"/>The winner decided by the judges was Eric Hartman, with The ACLerator. Congratulations Eric! The audience winner (decided via text message) was Laurel Christensen, with the Glowb. Congratulations Laurel. Your Glowb lights were awesome! </p>
<p>All the pitches were great! We&rsquo;re sure the judges had a hard time making their decision. Thanks to everyone who came out in support of this event. We were happy to see you and hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. If you missed the event, you can see videos of the pitches at 5across.org. We hope to see you at the August 24th event!</p>
