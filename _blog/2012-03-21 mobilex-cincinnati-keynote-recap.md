<p>MobileX Cincinnati started off with the morning keynote delivered by <a href="http://www.danielodio.com/about-me/" target="_blank">Daniel Odio</a>, CEO of <a href="http://www.getsocialize.com/" target="_blank">Socialize</a>, which makes apps social. Odio has also been featured on CNN, CNBC, TLC, Forbes, BBC and other media outlets. The talk covered topics on the current state of mobile, mobile entrepreneurship, big trends and opportunities, and efficiency tips.</p>
<p>Odio began by discussing how there is a major problem in mobile applications in terms of making sure that users stay involved with your app.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once somebody downloads your app, they don&rsquo;t stay engaged in your app,&rdquo; Odio said. &ldquo;You do all this work and only 35 percent of users on average even open it after downloading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Odio, even with smart phones being as big as they are, the usage rate of smart phones just passed 50 percent. However, the mobile growth rate curve literally looks like a straight, vertical line and Android is exploding. It&rsquo;s doubled its market share to 52 percent and now has a higher market share than the iPhone.<img alt="Daniel Odio" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7192/6998384469_334c6b7865.jpg" width="300"/></p>
<p>Odio then shared what he likes to call the mobile pyramid. The mobile pyramid consists of apps on the top, mobile web in the middle and SMS/texting on the bottom. Functionality and richness of experience is on the y-axis, and distribution is on the x-axis (potential audience size).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mobile is unsexy things like SMS, very wide distribution with very low richness of experience or sexiness factor &hellip; It can be very useful though. Moving up the pyramid we have mobile web. Mobile web still has problems with fragmentation, meaning the browsers on the phones don&rsquo;t display mobile content equally, but it&rsquo;s a lot better with fragmentation issues on native,&rdquo; Odio said. &ldquo;So you can get much wider distribution because most smart phones do have browsers and you get a much richer experience especially with HTML 5, especially with technologies like PhoneGap, where you can start accessing previously native only functionality of the phone and displaying that interactively through the browser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Odio paused for a brief moment and then asked who in the room was familiar with PhoneGap. About half of the audience raised their hands. He then goes on to elaborate on PhoneGap and why apps like this, as well as apps in general, offer a much richer smart phone experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For those of you who aren&rsquo;t familiar [with PhoneGap] you need to know that because the phone is hardware and because the browser cannot reach down into the phone to access the hardware, usually when you open up a website on a phone you&rsquo;re not able to access things like the phones camera. And because apps are compiled software, just like Microsoft Word is compiled software, and it&rsquo;s actually software that gets installed on the phone, it has much deeper access to the phones functionality and features. And that&rsquo;s why apps are on the top of the pyramid. You can do very exciting things with the app that you can&rsquo;t do with the browser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Odio explained the paradox of choice when deciding how to launch an idea. &ldquo;There is this huge fight going on. Should you be only focused on the browser and HTML5 or should you focus on apps and on native. The problem with apps is that it&rsquo;s very narrow distribution; if you code something on Android, it&rsquo;s not going to work on the iPhone, so you have to do twice the work. There&rsquo;s a trade off here. You get very exciting features and functionality but there&rsquo;s very narrow distribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next topic was big mobile trends, with software gobbling up hardware was a focal point of this segment. An example of software replacing hardware is how the keyboard has disappeared from phones and now they are digital.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The phone is becoming much smarter. It&rsquo;s not just a phone, it&rsquo;s a hub. So for example, in the Apple store they&rsquo;re selling a radar detector, the detector is actually just the infrared sensor that sits on your dashboard, the brains of it is on your phone. You open an app, it&rsquo;s the radar detector app, you put the sensor on your dashboard and you&rsquo;ve got the radar detector. Thinking about ways to pair hardware to make the phone smarter is a very big growth area.&rdquo;</p>
<p>API&rsquo;s are another item that Odio touched upon. He gave an example of how IBM is making a command center in Rio that gathers data from 30 agencies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how they put it together because I&rsquo;m not on the inside of this project, but I can tell you that API&rsquo;s are what enables this type of thing to happen. When an organization makes their data available in a way that they want it to be consumed by others through an API, that lets other people be very creative with the results,&rdquo; Odio said of IBM&rsquo;s command center. &ldquo;I highly encourage you to play around with API&rsquo;s and try to do something creative with APIs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consumerization of business, mobile security, augmented reality and geofencing were also growth opportunities Odio discussed in his keynote.</p>
<p>The final topic of Odio&rsquo;s keynote were tips on how to be efficient. He introduced his concept of forced multiplication, which is how to be only one person yet be able to get as much done in a day as possible by using problem solving technology. These included:</p>
<p>CloudApp, which shows a thread between two parties. This allows users&rsquo; to take screen shots and then auto uploads it into a URL.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I use this thing 20-50 times a day. When I&rsquo;m on IM chat or sending an email or when I want to show something to somebody, it&rsquo;s a great way to share information and to share what&rsquo;s on your screen,&rdquo; Odio said of CloudApp. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a massive productivity tool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next productivity tool he introduced to the audience was Rapportive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has a raplet, if you&rsquo;re using Gmail for your mail you can install it. Whenever you send somebody an email, it searches everywhere for that email address and compiles results on the right side of the screen. You can see where they work; you can connect with them on LinkedIn or on Facebook,&rdquo; Odio said.</p>
<p>Boomerang is another technology Odio talked about. It allows a user to have an email returned to their inbox if the receiver hasn&rsquo;t replied, so you can remember to remind them to reply. It also allows users to send an email at a specific time in the near future, and to have your emails scheduled to return to the top of your inbox at a specific time enabling a user to not forget to reply.</p>
<p>Ad Retargeting, Jigsaw and Phone Tag were the other efficiency software&rsquo;s Odio discussed.</p>
