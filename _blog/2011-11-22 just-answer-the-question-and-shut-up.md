<p>I use parenthesis, commas, dash marks, and semicolons waaay too much.</p>
<p>The reason is because thoughts spur thoughts and ultimately when I write, I&rsquo;m having a conversation with myself - a conversation that ends up having more than one side&hellip;or more than two sides. So as I write I will toss in my narrative thoughts, or opposing ideas in the text of the article. I think I&rsquo;m going to cut down on this interrupts the flow of the argument, and ultimately detracts from the point I&rsquo;m trying to make.</p>
<p>Actually, the real reason I think I should probably cut this out is because it annoys me when people do it in person. I see it the most when someone is getting grilled about a business concept presentation that they just pitched â€“ particularly if they are well prepared.</p>
<p>Q: &ldquo;What price will you charge for your product?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A: &ldquo;Well we&rsquo;re not 100% sure. It depends on the market rate of inflation in China this year because that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;re getting them manufactured. We do have a contract with the manufacturer that&rsquo;s in place that should mitigate that risk, but a couple times in the past year there have been contracts broken by manufacturers in the area because the volatility of that economy. We also might have two luxury versions and one economy version instead of three luxury versions and two economy versions of the product. This will bring down our price range significantly because we don&rsquo;t think we can charge a significant premium if our product rang is only three instead of being able to stratify our pricing levels and consequently, value propositions over more five different product offerings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guy wanted one number..maybe two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;$100-$200&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>You gave him your concerns about the economic outlook of your suppliers local community and a monologue on the effects of the breadth of your product offering over your potential price range&hellip;.and in so doing showed a lack of decisiveness and more importantly a lack of confidence.</p>
<p>Any investor knows that there are variables, question marks, things that make a number or an answer less certain than a Law of Nature, especially in the startup world. If he or she wants to know the main risk factors or potential variables, let him or her ask. In the meantime just answer the question.</p>
