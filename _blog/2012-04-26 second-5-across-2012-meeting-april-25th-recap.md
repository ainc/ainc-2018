<p>The April 25th 5 Across event was a great success! The 5 pitches were:</p>
<p>•<strong>Eric Gaines</strong> presented Party Tutor which will provide college students with an easy to use smartphone app/website to access everything they need to allow them to have an awesome college experience as well as saving money at the same time!</p>
<p>•<strong>Grant Weherley</strong> and his team pitched SmartLit which is a bluetooth controllable outlet which can be set to automatically turn on or off when you leave your house (by detecting that your phone is out of range).</p>
<p>•<strong>Cameron Lippert</strong> pitched Last Call Beverages, which is a Beverage for hangover pre-treatment. This beverage, when taken during alcohol consumption, will scavenge the toxins produced from alcohol metabolism therefore reducing hangover sympton or even preventing them all together.</p>
<p>•<strong>David Nelson</strong> pitched EHW, LLC which will create an improved walker for the elderly. Many current medical devices are &ldquo;sterile,&rdquo; lack emotionally supportive design, and convey a sense of morbid responsibility. This causes people to not use home-health products when they should. This problem is solved by designing a walker that people simply want to use. A device that has an organic feel, friendly features, and enticing curves.</p>

<p>The winner decided by the judges was David Nelson who pitched EHW, LLC. The winner decided by the audience text-vote was Cameron Lippert with Last Call Beverages.</p>
<p>All of the pitches were great! We&rsquo;re sure the judges had a hard time making their decision. Thanks to everyone who came out in support of this event. We were happy to see you and hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. If you missed the event, you can see videos of the pitches at <a href="http://5across.org/" target="_blank">5across.org</a>.
