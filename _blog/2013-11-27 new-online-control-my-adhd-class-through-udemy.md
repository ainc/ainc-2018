<p>A couple of months ago I took a course to better manage email on a platform called Udemy.com - a way of teaching and buying individual classes - and I loved it! Email management is a terribly<em> dull</em> subject, but the flow was nice, and there were little quizzes and a variety of materials to learn from, so it was actually a great experience. Over the months since that experience, Control My ADHD has partnered with Udemy to offer a course of our own. <strong>Introducing</strong>&hellip;drumroll please&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/adhd-mastery-training-turn-symptoms-into-strengths/?" target="_blank">ADHD Mastery Training: Turning ADHD Symptoms into Strengths </a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m <strong>so</strong> pumped about this new course because the system works flawlessly, and it allows us to add a couple of awesome features, such as the ability for students to ask me questions if they get stuck or want to learn more! <strong>This course offers 19 video lessons in 8 modules</strong>, as well as a variety of step-by-step guides and resource lists, creating an ADHD support experience which we hope you will love! <strong>Some specific areas you will learn about:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Exactly how ADHD works in your brain and in your life and why it&rsquo;s important</li>
<li>Creating an internal map to help resist impulses and regain some control</li>
<li>How general wellness correlates with symptoms, and ways to boost health to think better</li>
<li>Tools and strategies for finally getting organized, prioritizing effectively, and overcoming stress</li>
<li>Sleep and it&rsquo;s relationship to ADHD, and how to get a great night&rsquo;s sleep</li>
<li>The <strong>one</strong> exercise that helps with <strong>all</strong> ADHD symptoms</li>
</ul><p>The course has only been live for about a week, but already the response has been fantastic. <em>The class already has over 550 students, and 28 five-star reviews</em><em>.</em></p>

<p>Another reason I&rsquo;m so excited to partner with Udemy is they will enable us to help more people with the ADHD support we offer, which is a huge challenge to overcome. Countless people have ADHD, and the majority have no way of finding out about the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/adhd-mastery-training-turn-symptoms-into-strengths/?" target="_blank">support options</a> that are available. Here&rsquo;s to working towards a future where no one in our ADHD tribe <strong>ever</strong> feels like they have to go it alone. There is so much potential for this class to touch thousands or <em>TENS</em> <em>of thousands</em> people&rsquo;s live. If this is something you think you or a loved one could use, I encourage you to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/adhd-mastery-training-turn-symptoms-into-strengths/?" target="_blank">check it out</a>! It could make all the difference. At the very least, I would love it if you could please click the following links to help us get the word out!
