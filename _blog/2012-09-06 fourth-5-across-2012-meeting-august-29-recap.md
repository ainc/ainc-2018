<p>The fourth 2012 5 Across meeting is officially in the books after some of the fiercest competition and best ideas yet were presented. The 5 pitches this time were:</p>
<p><strong>Mike Sullivan</strong> pitched <strong>Alliance Virtual Offices</strong> which combines three central components necessary to service mobile and work-from-home professionals: People, Place and Technology. Simply put, they deliver the complete virtual office.</p>
<p><strong>Sue Whitaker &amp; Daniel Morris</strong> pitched <strong>Wine Clubs Online</strong> which provides marketing services for wineries. They offer a website to drive wine consumers directly into the wine club page of wineries to increase membership.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph V. Alexander</strong> pitched <strong>triblueengineering.com</strong> which provides membrane products; blood oxygenators, gas separation units, industrial filtration units.</p>
<p><strong>Chris M.</strong> pitched <strong>Kitcase</strong> which is a &ldquo;mobile case that connects&rdquo;. Kitcase allows you to build your personal pocket kit with interchangeable accessories they call &lsquo;hard apps.&rsquo;</p>
<p><strong>Lauren &amp; Pam Stein</strong> pitched <strong>Local Bride</strong> which will provide recent brides with a way to sell used wedding items purchased to brides-to-be. This helps recoup money for the recent bride and helps save money for the bride-to-be or her family.</p>
<p>The judges picked <strong>Alliance Virtual Offices</strong> as the winner of this 5 Across event. The audience chose<strong>LocalBride</strong> with an overwhelmingly dominant vote. There must have been a lot of brides-to-be in the audience!</p>
<p>Thanks for packing the house for another successful and awesome 5 Across! Make sure to come out for the next event on Halloween 2012! It will be a blast!</p>
