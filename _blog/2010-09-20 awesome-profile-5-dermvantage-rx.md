<p>DermVantage Rx is a biotech cosmeceutical company. They license and sell intellectual property in the industry; their targeted primary customer is big pharmacy. DermVantage Rx also does its own drug development and distribution.</p>
<p>DermVantage Rx is currently working on transdermal drug delivery systems. Owner Johannes Kohler is a veteran of this technology from UK&rsquo;s Cold Spring Research campus. He had a revolutionary idea for a method to deliver Botox to the skin, and now has a non provisional patent for his technology.</p>
<p>Kohler&rsquo;s challenge has been moving closer to interested parties. However, since UK has a large hospital, it is a potential hotspot for the biotech cosmetic industry, and DermVantage Rx will possibly be partnering with another company soon.</p>
