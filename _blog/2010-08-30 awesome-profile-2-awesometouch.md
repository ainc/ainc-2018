<p><a href="http://awesometouch.org/" target="_blank">AwesomeTouch</a> is a company out of Awesome Labs. They build software for large format touch screens. The touch screen works like a giant iPhone, but it has custom applications developed for it, including a map, playback software, and a white board.</p>

<p>The goal of AwesomeTouch is to have touch screens in every retail store in the country in order to improve customer experience and increase sales. The large size of the touch screen makes it ideal for displaying large items like cars, boats, and furniture.</p>
<p>Awesome Labs director and AwesomeTouch founder Nick Such was on the UK solar car team and realized he wanted to continue managing large teams of engineers to create cool technology. After graduating, he thought he had only two options: to get a job or go to graduate school. Through Awesome Inc he realized he had the third option to start a company.</p>
<p>The challenges Such has faced have mostly been because of his age though. He hasn&rsquo;t had the opportunities for experience and connections that someone who has worked in the industry has had. However, AwesomeTouch has already had success; they were one of six winners in phase I of the KHIC BIG Idea competition.</p>
