<p>The October 26th 5 Across event was yet another success (see <a href="http://www.5across.org/" target="_blank">www.5across.org</a>). The 5 pitches were:</p>
<p><strong>Tommy Crush</strong> pitched Crambu, which is a survey platform intended to collect data from customers via their mobile phones. Promotions, such as raffles, giveaways, discounts and deals can be attached to these surveys to entice more responses. Crambu handles the backend of that process as well.</p>
<p><strong>Mohammed Syeed Siddique</strong> pitched Voice-Out, which is a software development company which will provide enterprise solution to decreases IT expenses and administration requirement to maintain required services. Voice-Out does this by IT consultation followed by providing Social Technology platform linked with Virtualization and Cloud technology.</p>
<p><strong>John Preston</strong> presented KidsLog, an app that will allow parents to track the growth and development of their children while building a worldwide database of growth and development patterns.</p>
<p><strong>Evan Leach and Scott Wagner</strong> presented Crowded. This free application uses live interactive play prediction and trivia at baseball games to test the knowledge of competing viewers. Players are awarded accolades and offered the incentive of prizes for top scores, which will be tied into stadium concessions and prizes. The user interface allows fans of all ages and sports knowledge to play, while effectively delivering advertisements for team and stadium sponsors.</p>

<p>All the pitches were great! KidsLog and Crowded were both tied for second place in both the judges vote and the audience vote! We&rsquo;re sure the judges had a hard time making their decision. Thanks to everyone who came out in support of this event. We were happy to see you and hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.
