<p>Last week several members of Team Awesome traveled to Boulder, Co to visit <a href="http://www.techstars.org/" title="Techstars" target="_blank">Techstars</a>. For the unfamiliar, Techstars is a mentor-ship driven summer-long program in Boulder and Boston for entrepreneurs to accelerate their business. They select about 20 companies from all over the nation to participate in the program. About 500 apply. At the end of the program Techstars holds demo day. This is an opportunity for the companies to pitch to potential investors to raise their first round of funding, most of them succeed. <br/><br/>Luke and I attended demo day last year. This year seven entrepreneurs from Lexington attended. We watched the 10 teams pitch their ideas to hundreds of investors. All of the pitches were solid, but our top picks were <a href="http://nextbigsound.com/" title="Next Big Soun" target="_blank">Next Big Sound</a>, <a href="http://www.spryplanner.com/" title="Spry Planner" target="_blank">Spry</a>, <a href="http://www.reteltechnologies.com/" title="Retel" target="_blank">Retel</a>, &amp; <a href="http://www.takecomics.com/" title="Take Comics" target="_blank">Take Comics</a>. <br/><br/>Awesome Inc plans to do something similar to Techstars called the Awesome Inc Experience next summer. <br/><br/>While in Boulder we also attended a few social media gatherings, visited the Techstars facilities, climbed a mountain, and did the thing in downtown Denver (just ask if you need to know). <br/><br/>It was a great trip and I&rsquo;m proud to be a part of Team Awesome. The seven of us that went on the trip and all the team members and supporters that we have in Lexington are a part of something big - something big that is changing the dynamics of the region and positively affecting the community and individuals. Thanks to everyone for their support. And thanks to Techstars for showing us what we have to shoot for.</p>
