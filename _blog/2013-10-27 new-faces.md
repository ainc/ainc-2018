<p id="docs-internal-guid-5d62536b-fbf3-b601-7c55-9096b9bd5546">You may have seen some new people around Awesome Inc, including yours truly. Although I’d like to say I’m the most important addition to the team, there are two other people (one new and one not so new) that are going to play an integral role here at Awesome Inc. One of the new faces you may have seen around is Theresa Simcic.</p>
<p>Theresa completed her undergrad studies at Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania then moved to Lexington in 2009 for grad school to pursue and hold master’s degrees in both Experimental Psychology and Public Policy. Aside from holding more degrees than most Team Alpha members, she’s helping to launch the new fellowship program while writing grants for Awesome Inc. The new fellowship program will be a revamped version of the previous accelerator program. When Theresa isn’t keeping Awesome Inc awesome, she likes to hike, play tennis, and hang out with her dog and “best bud” Dakotah.</p>

<p>Garrett Ebel is probably a familiar face for the long time Awesome Incers, and he recently returned from the the corporate world in Atlanta. Now, he’s back with even more enthusiasm this time to manage the space and Team Alpha. Garrett’s currently the Director of Daily Activities and Director of Friendship, which basically means he has to be nice and tie your shoes for you every once in a while (not really). 5spot shirts is one of his current projects at Awesome Inc, which is a socially focused apparel brand that puts creating kindness as the main priority. Garrett graduated from the University of Kentucky’s Gatton College of Business with a degree in Business Management and Analytics and also holds an MBA. And if that wasn’t enough, Garrett plays on an indoor soccer team with Awesome Inc Founder, Brian Raney, salvages old barns, and works at a restaurant. He’s also learning how to flip houses… and babies according to his Facebook profile picture.</p>

<p>Again, I’d like to say that I’m the most important addition to the team (you wouldn’t be reading this if it wasn’t for me) but Theresa and Garrett will play an even more important part in Awesome Inc’s future. Awesome Inc Founder, Brian Raney, had these good words to say about them, &quot;Adding Garrett and Theresa to the team was an easy decision for us.  Both of them embody our core values and fit the culture of Awesome Inc.  We&rsquo;re really excited to have them on board.&ldquo; We are definitely excited for what’s to come and if your shoes ever need tying, Garrett’s just one call away.</p>
