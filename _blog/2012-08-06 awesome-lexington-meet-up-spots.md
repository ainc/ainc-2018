<p>Lexington is quite fortunate to have a number of great local places to have a meeting or event. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a coffee shop or a bar, Lexington has something for any type of meet up. So here&rsquo;s a list of some of the awesome places to meet up in town:</p>
<p><a href="http://thebeertrappe.com/" target="_blank">The Beer Trappe</a><br/><em>811 E Euclid Ave</em><br/>The Beer Trappe opened up a few years ago as the first bar in town focused solely on craft beer. Located right in the middle of Chevy Chase, across from Lexington hang-out staple Charlie Brown&rsquo;s, the Beer Trappe is in a central location surrounded by great restaurants and other local businesses. The place itself is a laid back, yet classy joint and a wonderful place to get together with 3 or 4 others for any purpose. Just beware of those high ABV beers!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.victoriansquareshoppes.com/dining-nightlife/chase-tap-room" target="_blank">The Chase Tap Room</a><br/><em>401 W </em>Main St<br/>Located in the historic Victorian Square, right across from Rupp Arena and the Civic Center, the Chase Tap Room is an upscale bar with one of the best drink selections in town. Despite being upscale, it doesn&rsquo;t feel too stuffy and it manages to create a relaxed atmosphere. While they have an awesome beer selection (including local brews), if you&rsquo;re more interested in, say, bourbon then definitely go give The Chase Tap Room a visit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Coffea/117376468280392" target="_blank">Coffea Island</a><br/><em>385 Rose St</em><br/>Coffea Island is the coffee house of choice near UK&rsquo;s campus. It&rsquo;s location on Rose Street makes it the closest, but they certainly aren&rsquo;t lacking in the coffee department. It&rsquo;s often crowded with students during the day, especially when finals are near, but it&rsquo;s a very relaxed environment that would be perfect for a meeting.</p>
<p><a href="http://coffeetimescoffeehouse.com/" target="_blank">Coffee Times Coffee House</a><br/><em>2571 Regency Road</em><br/>Coffee Times is a bit further away from downtown, but people really tend to love it. The prices are fair, the atmosphere cozy and the coffee is fantastic.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.commongroundsoflexington.com/" target="_blank">Common Grounds Coffee House</a><br/><em>343 East High Street</em><br/>Common Grounds is probably Lexington&rsquo;s choice of coffee places. It&rsquo;s been around the longest and does all the things local coffee shops usually do; hosts open mic nights and poetry readings and sells local art among other things. They&rsquo;ve got great, comfortable seating so it&rsquo;s always a good place to meet up.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.countryboybrewing.com/" target="_blank">Country Boy Brewing</a><br/><em>436 Chair Ave</em><br/>Country Boy is one of two local breweries to open up in the last year, and they really have outdone themselves with their creative and delicious brews. If you&rsquo;re looking for interesting beer, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with Country Boy. It should be noted that it can get pretty loud in Country Boy, so if you&rsquo;re trying to be productive it might not be the best place to go. On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re looking for a more informal place to meet up, it&rsquo;s perfect.</p>
<p><a href="http://eatgreatbagel.com/" target="_blank">Great Bagel Company</a><br/><em>396 Woodland Ave</em><br/>Great Bagel opened up in the last year and has lived up to the name; they have really great bagels. They also serve great bagel sandwiches and great coffee so you can&rsquo;t go wrong here. They have comfortable seating and free WiFi, but they do close rather early, so if you want to meet there, make sure to do it before they close at 3PM.</p>
<p><a href="http://lexingtonbeerworks.com/home/" target="_blank">Lexington Beerworks</a><br/><em>213 N Limestone</em><br/>Lexington Beerworks is Lexington&rsquo;s newest craft brew bar and they&rsquo;ve really put together a wonderful bar. The patio is a fantastic to hang out and the beer on tap is always great. They often have regional beers on tap and rarer beers that other places can&rsquo;t get. They even sell home-brewing equipment and host events to teach people about it. I can&rsquo;t recommend this place enough for any purpose.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mageesbakery.com/" target="_blank">Magee&rsquo;s Bakery</a><br/><em>726 East Main Street</em><br/>Magee&rsquo;s is a Lexington staple and for good reason. They really have the greatest donuts and baked goods I&rsquo;ve ever had anywhere in my life. The coffee they serve is absolutely fantastic and to top it off they have some great sandwiches. It&rsquo;s a bakery though, and like Great Bagel they close early so make sure to go before they close at 4.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marikkas.com/" target="_blank">Marrika&rsquo;s Bier Stube</a><br/><em>411 Southland Dr.</em><br/>Marrika&rsquo;s is Lexington&rsquo;s best German restaurant but they also have a huge bar and patio, over 700 beers to choose from, volleyball, darts, billiards and foosball. For larger groups, Marrika&rsquo;s is the perfect informal spot to meet as they have plenty of space and plenty to do.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pazzospizzapub.com/" target="_blank">Pazzo&rsquo;s Pizza Pub</a><br/><em>385 S Limestone</em><br/>Pazzo&rsquo;s is a UK tradition and a great spot to grab a beer and eat some pizza. They&rsquo;ve got a huge beer selection and the pizza is some of the best in town. They&rsquo;ve got big tables and plenty of space so it never seems too crowded or too loud. It&rsquo;s a good place to meet over lunch or dinner with large or small groups.</p>
<p><a href="http://valotta.com/" target="_blank">Sunrise Bakery</a><br/><em>111 West Main Street</em><br/>Sunrise is a newer bakery in town but they&rsquo;ve got some really fantastic food. The sandwiches are phenomenal and their fresh bread and pastries are just as good. It&rsquo;s a smaller place so meeting with large groups isn&rsquo;t recommended but for 2 or 3 people it&rsquo;s the perfect spot downtown.</p>
<p><a href="http://thirdstreetstuff.com/" target="_blank">Third Street Stuff &amp; Coffee</a><br/><em>257 N Limestone</em><br/>Third Street is another smaller local coffee shop downtown but unlike the others, it&rsquo;s a very eclectic place that you couldn&rsquo;t possibly miss. They have a lot of interesting coffee and sandwich choices but they&rsquo;re all quite delicious. The &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; part of Third Street Stuff is the shop, which sells locally made art, jewelry and various trinkets that are usually quite colorful and unique. If you&rsquo;re looking for somewhere a little different, Third Street is the place to go.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.westsixth.com/" target="_blank">West Sixth Brewing Company</a><br/><em>501 West 6th Street</em><br/>West Sixth is Lexington&rsquo;s newest brewery, and while they&rsquo;re a bit more traditional in their brewing choices than Country Boy, they make some really outstanding beers. As a place to meet up, it&rsquo;s got plenty of space and seating. Not only that, but their business is really a testament to their entrepreneurial spirit and is a remarkable success, especially considering the short period they&rsquo;ve been open.<br/><br/></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to note that all of these places are local businesses and certainly are deserving of your money. Of course, if you really want Starbucks then you can always go there, too. Regardless, every Star Trek fan should remember Ferengi Rule of Acquisition number 59: &ldquo;free advice is seldom cheap.&rdquo; So get out there, start buying drinks and supporting your local businesses!</p>
