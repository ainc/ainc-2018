<p><strong>Tyler Green: A renaissance man in the making</strong></p>
<p>One can&rsquo;t sum up Tyler Green in just a few sentences. This UK Computer Engineering senior and Students Today, Alumni Tomorrow (STAT)/TEAM WILDCAT member has a diverse set of interests that, at first, seem like a bit of a conundrum.</p>
<p>He enjoys photography, reading, and ballroom dancing, to name a few. He also loves to travel and in 2012 made it his goal to travel out of state once a month. Incorporating his love of travel, stadiums, and technology, he created a website that chronicles his journeys to sports stadiums. How&rsquo;s that for well-rounded?</p>
<p>First things first, Green is an active, devoted member of the UK Alumni Association&rsquo;s STAT/TEAM WILDCAT groups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me, TEAM WILDCAT was a no-brainer (to join), as they emphasized athletic spirit and travel to support UK,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The bus trips are far and away the best activities I&rsquo;ve gotten to experience. Sports and stadium travel are one of my primary interests that I pursue on my own with family and friends, so having the opportunity to complete that same goal with large groups of peers has been perfect. I have joined TEAM WILDCAT on overnight trips to football games at Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Missouri, as well as day trips for men&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s basketball and women&rsquo;s soccer in Louisville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Green feels that even though he is not yet a graduate, the association has played a valuable role in his time as a UK student and provided him many opportunities to connect with UK&rsquo;s vast alumni community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having a connection with the UK Alumni Association will benefit students for the rest of their lives by providing a community of individuals with similar backgrounds, regardless of where you end up living,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;This could be having a leg up on a job opportunity because of a UK connection with an employer or simply having fellow UK fans with whom to watch a game. I actually have a perfect example of this: I was visiting Indianapolis in 2011 on the day of a UK basketball game. During the drive up, I looked up the location of the local UK Alumni Association game watch party and was able to navigate to that establishment. As a result, I was able to watch the game with fellow UK fans and talk about the team, UK, and Lexington, as if I had never left home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of leaving home, Green has traveled to 43 stadium venues across the country. His casual interest of stadiums developed into something more during an internship his freshman year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was interning at Awesome Inc., a Lexington company that promotes entrepreneurship, and had some free time to learn some new programming languages using online resources,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Being immersed in this entrepreneurial environment caused me to channel my interests into a creative endeavor, so I created a shell website using databases that allowed individual user accounts. However, I still needed a topic on which to focus my development, so I picked my casual interest of stadiums. I had always enjoyed visiting a new stadium when I had the opportunity, but I never went out of my way to do so. After making it the subject of the site, it became a primary interest, one which actually became the sole reason for taking many trips. I had always traveled and watched sports with my family, but having a personal hobby such as visiting stadiums, as well as having an engineering focus with the website behind it, really caused my interest to take off. My Stadium Fanatic profile currently lists 43 stadiums I have visited, and about two-thirds of these have come since the July 2010 launch of the website. There are a couple hundred users on the website, and it continues to be an excellent showcase and talking point during job interviews. I am proud of how it represented a fusion of my technical and extracurricular interests. It also motivates me to complete goals of visiting all 30 Major League Baseball parks (I am currently at 11) and 14 SEC Football Stadiums (I am currently at six.)&rdquo;</p>

<p>After graduating from UK in May, Green plans to attend graduate school for a master&rsquo;s degree in Computer Engineering. He hopes to find a school that combines great academics and athletics with an urban environment.</p>
<p>With students like Green, it is easy to see why we have such great alumni! We look forward to welcoming this &ldquo;renaissance man in the making&rdquo; to the alumni family in just a few months. Who knows what he&rsquo;ll be up to once he graduates!</p>
