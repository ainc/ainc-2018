<p>Traveling always has its ups and downs. When you reach your destination, the last thing you want is a problem with your hotel room. Whether it is a lack of towels or some other issue, dealing with the front desk should be easier than it is.</p>
<p>Enter Crambu, the personal concierge solution created by David Booth and Tommy Crush. David, an economics and finance major, and Tommy, a business and computer science major, both juniors at the University of Kentucky, saw the need for innovation in the hotel industry. Crambu went through multiple iterations, beginning as a simple text based solution for guest feedback, evolving into a full graphic interface for guest interaction. Working with George Ward, a local Bluegrass Angel, David and Tommy have developed a tool that has the potential to redefine the standard for guest satisfaction in the hotel industry.</p>
<p>Instead of having to call the front desk, guests using Crambu are able to handle most requests through their mobile phone or tablet device. Since there is no app to download, Crambu works with both smart phones and non-smart phones. The Crambu interface gives guests the power to send requests for items such as towels or other essential items, like soap. Forget your toothbrush? Use Crambu to let the front desk know. The front desk will send a confirmation to your request, leaving no uncertainty as to whether or not your request was received.</p>
<p>Crambu is not just for finding solutions to common hotel room problems. Pertinent information, such as how to access wifi, location of vending machines, pool and restaurant hours, television channel guide, etc. are all at your fingertips. Crambu also provides information for the local area, suggesting potential dinner attractions and entertainment options, along with local emergency information.</p>
<p>The best part about Crambu is the price. It is free for all guests. David and Tommy have a promising addition to the hotel experience. A true personal concierge for guests who are looking to streamline and simplify their travel experience.</p>
