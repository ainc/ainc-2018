<p>I had the privilege of hearing Steve Blank speak in person at the Techstars Network Conference in Las Vegas. If you are familiar with Steve Blank, you probably know him to be the king of Customer Development. Naturally, that was the topic on which Steve spoke.</p>
<p>Steve taught me two things that day:</p>
<p><strong>First, get out of the building and search for the business model.</strong></p>
<p>You cannot know what your customers want without talking to them. That is why it is so important to talk to as many potential customers as possible as soon as possible. This process can be broken down into 4 steps as shown in the diagram below:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1. Customer Discover</strong> - So, you think you have a solution to a problem. &ldquo;No offense, but chances are you don&rsquo;t&rdquo;&hellip;or at least chances are you don&rsquo;t have a solution that solves a problem in a way that people are willing to pay for it. You are at pre-Product-Market Fit. You should build a really simple MVP (minimum viable product) and start showing it to potential customers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Customer Validation</strong> - Once you have built a product that customers need and you&rsquo;ve been able to validate this through high user adoption (or people actually giving you their money for your product) you are at Product-Market fit. People often ask the question, &ldquo;Has my business found product-market-fit?&rdquo; I heard Alexander Osterwalder give a talk at an <a href="http://etl.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">ETL lecture series</a> at Stanford University where he answered this question with, &ldquo;If you are asking the question, then the answer is no.&rdquo; Product market fit is when your customers will kill you if you try to take it a way from them. It&rsquo;s like taking crack from an addict.</p>
<p>The next step is to validate your MVP and validate your sales and marketing strategies. You need to be able to prove that you have a business model where every dollar that you put in returns greater than one dollar back.</p>
<p>At this stage, a lot of times startups find out that they cannot validate their customers and need to pivot, or change, one or more components on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas" target="_blank">business model canvas</a>. This causes them to go back to step 1 - customer discovery. The decision to pivot should not be considered a step backwards, but rather a step closer to a business model where you can get customer validation.</p>
<p>In order to manage the psychology of a pivot, Steve says to do the following:</p>
<p>1. Tell your team not to freak out</p>
<p>2. Pivot customers/markets first, value props later</p>
<p>3. Share customer feedback with the entire team</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customer Creation</strong> - Grow customers from few to many. There are lots of ways to do this. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ries" target="_blank">Eric Ries</a>talks about engines of growth in his book <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/" target="_blank">The Lean Startup</a> - paid engine of growth, viral engine of growth, and sticky engine of growth. You can read about them <a href="http://www.deviantbits.com/blog/engines-of-growth.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Company Building</strong> - Build your company&rsquo;s organization and management. Often the founders will find others to run the company at this stage.</p>
<p>In summary, all of this starts outside of your building and in conversations with customers. So, stop selling and start listening.</p>

<p>The 2nd thing Steve taught me that day:</p>
<p><strong>Startups are not smaller versions of big companies.</strong></p>
<ul><li>Large companies execute known business models. Startups are searching for repeatable and scalable business models. Startups cannot be afraid that their value props might be wrong. You probably will be wrong&hellip;a lot of times. When you&rsquo;re wrong, tweak the idea (pivot) and build another MVP.</li>
</ul><ul><li>For a startup, writing a full blown business plan is a mistake. Sorry to all the investors in the Midwest who are reading this (which is likely zero) and have asked me for a business plan. Business plans aren&rsquo;t for startups. Neither are Financial Projections. They are a necessary evil that some investors will make you do. Writing a business plan for a startup is the equivalent to developing a full blown feature filled product as an alpha version (as opposed to an MVP). It&rsquo;s like deciding what you want your kid to be when he grows up at the age of 2 and fully investing in that. You might decide for your kid to be a pro NBA basketball player, but you don&rsquo;t know how big the kid will be, how athletic he will be, if the NBA will even be around in 20 years. Instead fill out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas" target="_blank">business model canvas</a>, write one pagers, prep slide decks, but do it all quickly.
<ul><li>Note: There is a benefit to thinking through some of the aspects of the business plan. However, I mostly just agree with Steve Blank&rsquo;s quote, &ldquo;Financial projections for startups are best taught in the English dept because they are such great creative writing&rdquo;. Treat them as such and don&rsquo;t spend a minute more on them than you absolutely must.</li>
</ul></li>
