Awesome Inc staff, interns, startup founders, spouses, and friends alike strived to discover the answer to “Why do I and my company exist?” We then examined the effect of this “why” on the “how” and the “what” of ourselves and our ideas. Each entry in the slate of sessions for the weekend spoke to this question, some by real-world training in the “how” and others by the refocusing of the “what.” But as Simon Sinek <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en" target="_blank">so eloquently put it,</a> the best companies “start with the why.”</p><p>In accordance with this philosophy, the first session of the weekend was “Your Why Has to be Stronger”, presented by Awesome Inc co-founder Brian Raney. He emphasized that the importance of discovering the why behind your work far exceeds the importance of the how or the what in entrepreneurship. Every organization knows what they do, the products they sell or the services they provide. Some even know how they will do it better than their competitors and leverage their competitive advantage. Very few have sought to understand why they find what they do a worthwhile use of their time and efforts. Yet this is what sets successful companies and entrepreneurs apart. This is because we will fail, sometimes very often, at what we do or how we do it. If there is not a strong reason why, there is no inspiration or drive to overcome the obstacles that inhibit the how and the what.  </p><p>Awesome Inc has spent years discovering the why for itself. Today, we can say that Awesome Inc exists to help people pursue their definition of awesome. That is why we devote our time to building a high-tech startup community in Kentucky with our various initiatives like the <a href="https://fellowship.awesomeinc.org/" target="_blank">Awesome Fellowship</a> and <a href="https://www.awesomeincu.com/" target="_blank">Awesome Inc U</a>. Without that why, whenever an initiative flopped (there have been a few), we would become stuck, because we failed at our what. But because our purpose is to help people, we still succeed, because even in those failures we are helping people in their pursuit of Awesome. For entrepreneurs, this has to be the same. The why can’t be money, because the reality is not all companies end up making money. But if the purpose is to fill a need, a passion to create change, then the why is strong enough.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="234" data-orig-width="640"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/33cdd54a39032dfe7170d699b67ab427/tumblr_inline_ocs7cmGnlP1spm8pc_540.jpg" data-orig-height="234" data-orig-width="640"/></figure><p>Each of the sessions that followed contributed to this theme. Gary Ditsch taught about figuring out how to measure the correct things in growing a business, by focusing on what you really want to achieve. Garrett Ebel spoke about surrounding yourself with a team of people who share your why, and Elzaba Matthews told her personal journey of pursuing her why, a story that spanned years of hard work across the globe.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="480" data-orig-width="640"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/a6b7e5dce3fa1a2259b7fd938ef1e531/tumblr_inline_ocs7cviVhU1spm8pc_540.jpg" data-orig-height="480" data-orig-width="640"/></figure><p>Between sessions, in the true spirit of Rule #17 (“Bring the fun!), attendees enjoyed morning workouts, challenging hikes, tubing adventures, and late-night games.</p><p>The full list of retreat sessions can be found below, and the corresponding notes <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14C9F6FTDOu8ZQXk9AhB2Q3efmEZxrN_RhHd5Butrxac/edit#gid=772584480" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><ol><li>Brian Raney, Awesome Inc Co-founder, <i>Your Why Has to Be Stronger Than All Your Obstacle</i>s.
